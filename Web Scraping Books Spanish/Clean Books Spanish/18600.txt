dr josé rizal escribió este último poema antes de ser ejecutado el de diciembre de en bagumbayan aunque el poema carecía de título en el original hemos optado por usar en esta edición el título con el que generalmente se le hace referencia mi ultimo adios adios patria adorada region del sol querida perla del mar de oriente nuestro perdido eden a darte voy alegre la triste mustia vida y fuera más brillante más fresca más florida tambien por tí la diera la diera por tu bien en campos de batalla luchando con delirio otros te dan sus vidas sin dudas sin pesar el sitio nada importa ciprés laurel ó lirio cadalso ó campo abierto combate ó cruel martirio lo mismo es si lo piden la patria y el hogar yo muero cuando veo que el cielo se colora y al fin anuncia el día trás lóbrego capuz si grana necesitas para teñir tu aurora vierte la sangre mía derrámala en buen hora y dórela un reflejo de su naciente luz mis sueños cuando apenas muchacho adolescente mis sueños cuando joven ya lleno de vigor fueron el verte un día joya del mar de oriente secos los negros ojos alta la tersa frente sin ceño sin arrugas sin manchas de rubor ensueño de mi vida mi ardiente vivo anhelo salud te grita el alma que pronto va á partir salud ah que es hermoso caer por darte vuelo morir por darte vida morir bajo tu cielo y en tu encantada tierra la eternidad dormir si sobre mi sepulcro vieres brotar un dia entre la espesa yerba sencilla humilde flor acércala a tus labios y besa al alma mía y sienta yo en mi frente bajo la tumba fría de tu ternura el soplo de tu hálito el calor deja a la luna verme con luz tranquila y suave deja que el alba envíe su resplandor fugaz deja gemir al viento con su murmullo grave y si desciende y posa sobre mi cruz un ave deja que el ave entone su cantico de paz deja que el sol ardiendo las lluvias evapore y al cielo tornen puras con mi clamor en pos deja que un sér amigo mi fin temprano llore y en las serenas tardes cuando por mi alguien ore ora tambien oh patria por mi descanso á dios ora por todos cuantos murieron sin ventura por cuantos padecieron tormentos sin igual por nuestras pobres madres que gimen su amargura por huérfanos y viudas por presos en tortura y ora por tí que veas tu redencion final y cuando en noche oscura se envuelva el cementerio y solos sólo muertos queden velando allí no turbes su reposo no turbes el misterio tal vez acordes oigas de citara ó salterio soy yo querida patria yo que te canto á ti y cuando ya mi tumba de todos olvidada no tenga cruz ni piedra que marquen su lugar deja que la are el hombre la esparza con la azada y mis cenizas antes que vuelvan á la nada el polvo de tu alfombra que vayan á formar entonces nada importa me pongas en olvido tu atmósfera tu espacio tus valles cruzaré vibrante y limpia nota seré para tu oido aroma luz colores rumor canto gemido constante repitiendo la esencia de mi fé mi patria idolatrada dolor de mis dolores querida filipinas oye el postrer adios ahi te dejo todo mis padres mis amores voy donde no hay esclavos verdugos ni opresores donde la fé no mata donde el que reyna es dios adios padres y hermanos trozos del alma mía amigos de la infancia en el perdido hogar dad gracias que descanso del fatigoso día adios dulce extrangera mi amiga mi alegría adios queridos séres morir es descansar end of the project gutenberg ebook of mi ultimo adiós by jose rizal end of this project
