prevented his realizing promise his early years he died april was buried cemetery san lorenzo historical introduction when philip iv became king spain he inherited a kingdom whose resources had been recklessly wasted his father philip iii had been ruled by most inept ministers duke lerma great sums money wrung from productive lower classes had been spent carry on a fruitless war netherlands provide amusement for an idle frivolous court fill pockets ministers creatures government was hands a bureaucracy parasites collective conscience governing class had withered died officeholders this bureaucracy had come regard acquisition riches at expense state as one their official privileges if spain were maintain her preëminent position as greatest power europe most radical economic reform was necessary stimulus must be given productive activity country by relief from oppressive taxation expenditure must be wisely restrained administered situation demanded a man exceptional keenness vision great energy absolute integrity there were not lacking men who foresaw disaster that threatened men who still kept some that energy fearlessness that had made america a spanish dependency but such individuals were silenced as menaces rather than encouraged as helpers philip himself mental vigor physical stamina spanish hapsburgs had been greatly diminished consanguineous marriages his immediate ancestors had weakened stock there can be no doubt that he loved his people his own pitiful ineffectual way but he was hopelessly weak lacking ability even will rule he delegated government don gaspar de guzmán count olivares soon be first duke san lúcar here on other hand was a man undoubted energy courage yet his weakness was his utter lack vision his inability profit by mistakes his predecessors he had many a lesson learn failure reigns philip ii philip iii he should have seen that reason for disasters former was continuance a hopeless war netherlands for sake an ideal religious unity which progress sixteenth century had made impossible above all he should have realized economic folly a system taxation industrial repression that was choking nation olivares himself was blame for initial appearance machinery state only a few vital weaknesses for at beginning his administration many fatal tendencies were already at work but because he failed check those tendencies he must ever be scapegoat be sure he signalized his arrival by a few months rigid economy but he did not cut deep enough he soon realized futility saving where there was nothing save then either because he failed see source evil because he lacked constructive ability attack it he went extreme lavish expenditure as situation grew more more hopeless he temporized striving hide internal decay beneath a gilded exterior ostentatious wealth as he plunged deeper his critics grew bolder silence them his rule became more barbarously arbitrary moreover he found himself face face with great richelieu at head a rich welladministered france under him france was become organized extend her dominions her natural physical boundariesat expense spain olivares ruled spain from until richelieu ruled france from until it was a lifelong duel between two ministers richelieu laid foundation for greatness louis xiv while olivares made inevitable abject impotence spain under charles ii culminating disasters began arrive with rebellion catalonia determination catalans grant philip no more arbitrary taxes marks beginning revolt that ended with entire loss catalonia olivares could never forget its opposition his will while catalans were bravely resisting entrance french troops into roussillon santa coloma viceroy olivares made even more severe his policy sternness repression catalans were be driven against french be made understand by application brute force that welfare their particular province was small importance beside prosperity kingdom general spanish soldiers quartered upon them behaved with such lawlessness that may population barcelona broke into open rebellion santa coloma was cut down his attempt escape consequences his lack diplomacy tact from barcelona revolt soon spread through entire province it has been said that gentle measures repression inaugurated by new viceroy duke cardona particularly displeased olivares who saw at last what he believed be his opportunity utterly crush catalan liberty answer catalans was throw themselves into hands french richelieu by seeking foreign aid against castile september an army under marqués de los vélez was sent north straighten out tangled affairs catalonia at first he was successful but january he was beaten back from barcelona itself after a bloody defeat at hands local soldiery make sure french aid rebels offered their allegiance louis xiii france revolt was kept alive with french money soldiers while philips armies were invariably defeated complete our picture political situation we must turn for a moment portugal there reluctant allegiance spanish crown had already been severely strained during previous reign by highhanded procedure lerma favorite philip iii portuguese administrative offices had been filled madrid country was inconsiderately taxed maintain castilian sovereignty under philip iv regent kingdom was doña margarita duchess mantua granddaughter philip ii while she was ostensibly control difficult portuguese situation real ruler was don miguel vasconcellos a portuguese scant ability bloodthirsty instincts he was kept command by olivares dictating from madrid announcement vasconcellos nation that it was intention olivares remove last vestige constitutional rule portugal by suppression portuguese cortes drove patriots rally about duke braganza a wellplanned conspiracy was set on foot place braganza on throne portugal thus rid country forever hated castilian sovereignty footnote philip ii had married his daughter infanta catalina charles emmanuel savoy after failure all his attempts bring braganza madrid olivares tried desperately win his favor by apparently putting fate portugal entirely his hands it was a fatal course olivares sent him large sums money raise troops keep portuguese situation control help repression catalans then he put braganza at head them november braganza proclaimed himself king regent margaret was imprisoned vasconcellos was killed by mob news was received madrid with deepest dismay pellicer wrote these announcements should be written with blood deserve be wept over rather than written for they contain nothing less than rebellion portugal coronation don juan whom they call juan iv duke braganza it is commonly stated that olivares announced news rebellion philip by congratulating him upon opportunity thus offered seize property braganza footnote avisos de de diciembre de add troubles portugal catalonia just described a plot by duke medina sidonia make himself independent sovereign andalusia was discovered only just time prevent a serious rising advisability philips putting himself person at head troops north had long been subject earnest bitter discussion between olivares his enemies latter had urged upon philip necessity seeing with his own eyes pass which matters had been brought by ineptitude recklessness his minister this could best be accomplished by a visit inspection revolted provinces moreover with philip olivares away from capital queen those nobility who were working for downfall olivares could proceed with a freer hand when once royal party had left doña isabel set about her task with true nobility great energy she was almost heroic her efforts encourage inspire with loyalty crown troops garrisoned madrid she even sold her jewels raise money for campaign aragon philip meanwhile was traveling slowly northward with great pomp ceremony olivares was straining every nerve prevent kings realizing desperateness situation monarch was denied all visitors his attention was distracted by elaborate hunting expeditions as he progressed toward aragon french moving southward occupied monzón december found philip again madrid portugal was hopelessly lost roussillon was hands french while catalonia aragon were open revolt briefly sketched this was political situation at opening our play while spain was at this time economically bankrupt reigns philip iii philip iv comprise nevertheless most brilliant decades golden century these are years that are marked by greatest literary activity lope de vega cervantes quevedo lope had made theater national had prepared way for romantic genius calderón while a throng lesser lights such as tirso de molina juan ruiz de alarcón were delighting capital with plays great profusion for all this a great stimulus had come from theaterloving philip iii who lavished money without stint upon gorgeous production comedies pageants masques cervantes had shown way novelists prose fiction true characterization had developed keep pace with extensive elaborate narrative elements at same time outburst lyric poetry was no less striking ability write verse had become truly a necessary qualification for social success even for political advancement great magnates surrounded themselves with a retinue poets men letters who depended upon them for their support don francisco de quevedo y villegas central figure our play was one greatest personalities this brilliant court he was born at barely twenty he left university alcalá plunged immediately into life magnificently corrupt court philip iii at valladolid when capital was moved madrid he had already won fame as a poet manuscripts his satirical writings prose verse were eagerly sought widely read his thrusts were aimed at ridiculous aspects court life his own indulgence a career thorough dissipation filled him with contempt for his wretched companions intimate association with men high positions reached by either noble birth corrupt influence made him familiar with vices philips government with ineffectiveness spanish bureaucratic administration his sueños visions he satirized unsparingly men from all walks life his attacks were at times mocking jeers at human weaknesses at others outbursts desperate fury against current injustice stupidity after a short period retirement from capital he became firm friend don pedro téllez girón duke osuna who had been named viceroy sicily uncommonly strong bond friendship between these two men was founded upon mutual admiration common qualities fearlessness redblooded dash spirit quevedo followed osuna naples where he was great service him as adviser confidential emissary these years semiofficial activity brought quevedo into very midst tangle politics involving france italy spain above all into bog bureaucratic corruption osunas business madrid with prime minister lerma was managed by quevedo now lerma his creatures were amenable reason only when accompanied by bribes access him was denied all who brought no gifts quevedos disgust at these methods was boundless but there was no avoiding them recognition his distinguished services quevedo was made a knight order st james footnote no less a person than attorney general wrote osuna a prominent person at court your excellency may be quite sure m he wants a carpet send him two pray god that some one else does not give him three footnote play there is a trifling anachronism according which we are believe that quevedo had not yet received this honor osuna came madrid answer charge having conspired make himself independent viceroy naples on his arrival he was thrown into prison while quevedo was held custody at a distance from madrid osuna died before his guilt innocence could be clearly proved quevedo afterward fought clear his protectors name at least he has secured his fame posterity by famous sonnet faltar pudo su patria al grande osuna pero no a su defensa sus hazañas diéronle muerte y carcel las españas de quien el hizo esclava la fortuna lloraron sus invidias una a una con las propias naciones las extrañas su tumba son de flandes las campañas y su epitafio la sangrienta luna while quevedo was enduring his enforced retirement philip iii died march was succeeded by his son philip iv uceda formers minister was sent follow his father lerma into retirement disgrace olivares who had already won confidence young philip was installed as prime minister superficial reforms by which olivares signalized his arrival momentarily led quevedo hope for better things he wrote celebrate wisdom new minister assure him his loyalty he was soon at liberty enjoy fame wholesome respect that his political prominence keen satire had won him his enemies were numerous but they dared not attack him olivares himself courted quevedo but latter grown discreet for moment lent his ear not his heart he could not give himself a minister who was already beginning show his unwillingness go root evils that were ruining country during these years comparative political inactivity quevedo had greater opportunity study vicious standards living that stain this period spanish history his writings are full scathing irony his youth on one hand passionate religious fervor on other at other moments he indulges his tendency seek refuge comfort gentle stoicism seneca his reckless slurs on women did not prevent his taking a wife perhaps doña esperanza de aragón possessed qualities that quevedo had flippantly demanded noble virtuous good understanding neither ugly nor beautiful these two extremes i prefer her beautiful because it is better have something guard than some one flee from neither rich nor poor that she may not be buying me nor i her i desire her cheerful for our daily life we shall not lack for gloom i wish her neither a young girl nor an old woman cradle nor coffin because i have forgotten my lullabies not yet learned prayers for dying i should thank god infinitely if she were deaf a stammerer but after all i shall esteem a woman such as i desire y sabré sufrir la que fuere como yo la merezco their married life was cut short by death doña esperanza middle following year there can be no doubt quevedos thinlyveiled distrust administration olivares during these years nor that he foresaw impending catastrophe campaign which he was now carrying on against favorite drew upon him not only fear but hatred olivares philip himself was blind state peninsula thanks olivares successful efforts keep him amused finally one day early december philip found his napkin a petition verse it contained an eloquent description wretched condition country a bitter arraignment olivares every circumstance pointed quevedo as author on seventh december he was arrested his papers were confiscated his disappearance was so sudden complete that it was generally believed that he had been summarily done death but reality he had been rushed a dungeon monastery san marcos just outside walls city león here he received treatment probably intended cause his death for he wrote his friend adán de la parra although at first i had a tower this holy dwelling for my prison within a short time i was brought another a great deal more comfortless there i remain it is nothing more than an underground room as damp as a spring so dark that it is almost always night it so cold that it never ceases seem january clear enough they that take pleasure seeing me suffer do not wish cut once for all that which they must finally cut but they wish rather that frequency their blows may make my martyrdom more painful by its longer continuance for thus their satisfaction gains length tomb where i am buried alive is barely twentyfour feet long nineteen wide vault walls are many places crumbling with dampness everything is so miserable that it appears rather refuge outlaw robbers than prison an honest man enter it one must pass through two doors equally strong one is at level monastery floor other at level my cell after twentyeight steps that have look a precipice both are always closed except at moments when more by courtesy than through confidence they leave one open but other doubly guarded middle room there stands a table where i am writing it is large enough permit thirty more books with which my holy brothers keep me provided at right south i have my neither very comfortable nor extremely wretched bed furniture this miserable habitation consists four chairs a brasier a lamp there is always noise enough for sound my fetters drowns other greater ones if not by its volume by its pitifulness not long ago i had two pairs but one monks obtained permission leave me with only one pair those that i am wearing now weigh about eight nine pounds ones they took off were much heavier such is life which i have been reduced by him who because i would not be his favorite is today my enemy he endured his confinement with fortitude sustained by conviction that he had given his best for cause justice series disasters that ultimately caused fall olivares on january has been discussed another part this introduction quevedos release followed june but iron had already entered his soul a little more than two weeks before his death he wrote his friend francisco de oviedo a tone profound discouragement they write bad news from everywhere desperate news worst it is that every one expected it all this don francisco i know not if it be drawing its close if it be already ended god knows for there are many things which though they seem exist have being are no longer more than a word a form he died at age sixtyfive on september at villanueva de los infantes even bare enumeration more important events quevedos life suggests his eager activity this characteristic is most striking feature his style an idea is no sooner suggested than it is left undeveloped make way for another set down often a sentence which its turn is without a satisfactory conclusion expression it is so condensed that we marvel at its retaining any lucidity many his earlier writings are little more than a series sketches that appear have been written with feverish impatience but at same time with great penetration his satirical verses there is a world double meanings allusions that leaves readers mind dizzy variety his works is great his facile creative brain passed from a ribald ballad letrilla a life st francis de sales a treatise on divine providence but through them all one can discern motif patriotism form virulent satire against vices that were gnawing at life nation a fervent plea for better standards public private life when he felt impotence his rage fruitlessness his pleas he turned earnestly longingly his cherished seneca but even this frame mind we cannot help feeling that there is something intensely passionate his very patience he gave his best years battle against national decay perhaps it is not too much say that he died disappointment disgust quevedos life then is by no means devoid aspects that would appeal strongly a romantic poet like florentino sanz most striking feature course is his struggle with olivares followed by apparent defeat imprisonment at san marcos de león which reality meant a moral victory face persecution this itself was an ideal situation call forth heroics a romantic poet furthermore quevedo could properly complain that he had been misunderstood he was giving himself a great cause while many his contemporaries recognized only superficial wit obscenity his satire his proud scorn stupidity all mediocrity was easily susceptible a romantic twist into a lofty contempt for miserable human creatures that drag out their darkened groveling lives make play an unqualified success it was necessary that quevedo succumb gentle passion although reality quevedos stern heart had little room for it there can be no denying his cynical disbelief feminine virtue associations his own choice gave him little opportunity for illusions on that score be sure he married at fiftytwo but circumstances lead us doubt his happiness quevedo love is thorny ground for any author it is difficult understand how sanz succeeded making this innovation as plausible as it is it is his surrender virtues so sterling as those margarita de saboya that saves him from being ridiculous perhaps one may be pardoned for a furtive smile at implication that quevedo must depart mope his tower while margarita herself a widow pines convent name quevedo has come connote vaguely a personage achievements as fabulous as those robin hood his undoubted skill as a swordsman has made him hero a thousand nocturnal escapades his proverbial wit has forced upon him responsibility for doubtful puns innumerable bits repartee unfortunately this is true such a degree that uninitiated quevedo is little more than a buffoon a swaggering swordsman it is easy see that his play sanz intended combat this mistaken conception when it was first presented there existed no authoritative accessible edition quevedos works where he could be adequately studied a fair estimate him made such works his as were spread broadcast were usually more objectionable excerpts from his less creditable works they appeared wretched volumes bearing a close resemblance some that are published even now under such titles as quevedo his wittiest prose his funniest verses sanz felt injustice deeply set about its correction footnote first volume fernándezguerras splendid edition appeared those who knew sanz personally have been left with clear impression that through medium quevedo sanz poured forth his invective against those that refused recognize his own ability footnote i speak especially don juan perez de guzman don julio nombela both whom have been kind enough give me all data at their disposal there can be no doubt that ultimate source rather inspiration play was appeal sanz personality quevedo there are other more tangible sources that may be briefly indicated an important element plot is queen isabels struggle obtain from olivares a certain letter which had been written blood by conde de villamediana which would prove her fidelity her husband philip existence such a valuable document is pure invention villamedianas contemporaries are unanimous saying that after being stabbed he died almost instantly that his only words were esto es hecho romantic circumstances villamedianas attachment queen had been rehearsed public only a few years before production don francisco de quevedo duke rivas had published his four ballads los toros las máscaras y cañas el sarao final under title el conde de villamediana affair then would be fresh minds sanz his public don juan de tassis y peralta count villamediana was born lisbon was brought up court philip
