memories russian court memories russian court chapter i it is with a prayerful heart memories deep reverent that i begin write story my long intimate friendship with alexandra feodorovna wife nicholas ii empress russia tragedy revolution which brought on her hers such undeserved misery on our unhappy country such a black night oblivion but first i feel that i should explain briefly who i am for though my name has appeared rather prominently most published accounts revolution few writers have taken trouble sift facts from fiction even comparatively unimportant matter my genealogy i have seen it stated that i was born germany that my marriage a russian officer was arranged conceal my nationality i have also read that i was a peasant woman brought from my native siberia further ambitions rasputine truth is that i am unable produce an ancestor who was not born russian my father alexander sergievitch tanieff during most his life was a functionary russian court secretary state director private chancellerie emperor an office held before him by his father his grandfather my mother was a daughter general tolstoy aidedecamp alexander ii one my immediate ancestors was field marshal koutousoff famous napoleonic wars another on my mother s side was count kontaisoff an intimate friend eccentric tsar paul son great catherine notwithstanding my family s hereditary connection with court our own family life was simple quiet my father aside from his official duties had no interests apart from his home his music for he was a composer a pianist more than national fame my earliest memories are home evenings my brother serge my sister alya alexandra studying their lessons under shaded lamp my dear mother sitting near with her needlework my father at piano working out one his compositions striking keys softly noting down his harmonies i thank god for that happy childhood which gave me strength soul bear sorrows sufferings after years six months every year we spent country near moscow on an estate which had been family for nearly two hundred years for neighbors we had princes galatzine grand duke grand duchess serge last named being older sister empress i hardly remember when i did not know love grand duchess elizabeth as she was familiarly called as small children she petted spoiled us all often inviting us tea feast ending a grand frolic which we were allowed search rooms for toys which she had ingeniously hidden it was at one these children s teas that i first saw empress alexandra quite unexpectedly tsarina was announced beautiful grand duchess elizabeth leaving her small guests ran eagerly greet her time was near beginning reign nicholas ii alexandra feodorovna tsarina was at very height her youthful beauty my childish impression her was a tall slender graceful woman lovely beyond description with a wealth golden hair eyes like stars very picture what an empress should be for my father young empress soon conceived a warm liking confidence she named him as vice president committee assistance par le travail during this time we lived winter michailovsky palace petrograd summer a small villa peterhof on baltic sea from conversations between my mother father i learned a great deal life imperial family empress impressed my father both by her excessive shyness by her unusual intelligence she was above all a motherly woman often combined babytending with serious business affairs with little grand duchess olga her arms she discussed all kinds business with my father while with one hand rocking cradle where lay baby tatiana she signed letters papers consequence sometimes while thus engaged there would come a clear musical whistle like a bird call it was emperor s special summons his wife at first sound her cheek would turn rose regardless everything she would fly answer it that birdlike whistle emperor i became very familiar with later years calling children signaling me it had a curious appealing resistless quality peculiar himself perhaps it was a common love music which first drew empress our family into a bond friendship all us children received a thorough musical education from childhood we were taken regularly concerts opera our home especially on wednesday evenings was a rendezvous for all musicians composers capital great tschaikovsky was a friend my father i remember many others note who were frequent guests at tea dinner apart from music we received an education rather more practical than was average at that time russia my childhood a girl good family was supposed acquire a few pretty accomplishments nothing much besides accomplishments i my sister were given but besides music painting for which my sister had considerable talent we were well grounded academic studies we finished by taking examinations leading teachers diplomas i may say also that even our drawingroom accomplishments we were obliged be thorough when my father ventured show some our work empress she expressed warm approval most russian girls she said seem have nothing their heads but officers empress coming from a small german court where everyone at least tried occupy themselves usefully found idle listless atmosphere russia little her taste her first enthusiasm power she thought change things a little for better one her early projects was a society handwork composed ladies court society circles each one whom should make with her own hands three garments a year be given poor society i am sorry say did not long flourish idea was too foreign soil nevertheless empress persisted creating throughout russia industrial centers maisons de travail where unemployed both men women especially unfortunate women who through errors conduct lost their positions could find work life at court was by no means serious fact it was at that time very gay at seventeen i was presented first empress dowager who lived a palace peterhof known as cottage extremely shy at first i soon accustomed myself many brilliant court functions which my mother chaperoned my sister myself we danced that first winter i remember at no less than twentytwo balls besides attending many receptions teas dinners perhaps it was partly fatigue all this social dissipation which made so serious illness with which ensuing summer i was stricken typhus that scourge russia struck down at same time my brother serge myself my brother s illness ran a normal course he made a rapid recovery but for three months i lay at death s door after fever succeeded many complications inflammation lungs kidneys an affection brain whereby i lost both speech hearing midst my suffering i had a vivid dream which saintly father john kronstadt appeared me told me have courage that all would finally be well this father john kronstadt whom all true russians reverence as a saint i remembered as having thrice been at our house my early childhood gentle majesty his presence beauty his benign countenance had so deeply impressed me that now my desperate illness it seemed me that he more than skilled physicians devoted sisters who attended me had power help healing some way i managed convey my parents that i wanted father john they immediately telegraphed begging him come it was some days before message reached him as he was away from home on a mission but as soon as he received word our need he hastened peterhof as a vision i sensed his coming long before he reached house when he came i greeted him without astonishment with a feeble movement my hand father john knelt down beside my bed praying quietly a corner his long stole laid over my burning head at length he rose took a glass holy water consternation nurses sprinkled it freely over me bade me sleep almost instantly i fell into a deep sleep when i awoke next day i was so much better that all could see that i was on road recovery september that year i went with my mother first baden afterwards naples we lived same hotel with grand duke grand duchess serge who were very much amused see me a wig my long illness having rendered me temporarily almost bald after a quiet but happy season southern italy i returned russia quite restored health winter i remember as a round gaieties dissipations january that year i received from empress diamondstudded chiffre maid honor which meant that following my marriage i would have permanent entry all court functions not immediately but very soon afterwards i was called duty person empress there began then that close intimate friendship which i know lasted with her always which will remain with me as long as god permits me live i would that i could paint a picture empress alexandra feodorovna as i knew her before first shadow doom disaster fell upon unhappy russia no photograph ever did her justice because it could reproduce neither her lovely color nor her graceful movements tall she was delicately beautifully shaped with exquisitely white neck shoulders her abundant hair red gold was so long that she could easily sit upon it when it was unbound her complexion was clear as rosy as a little child s empress had large eyes deep gray very lustrous it was only later life that sorrow anxiety gave her eyes melancholy with which they are usually associated youth they wore an expression constant merriment which explained her family nickname sunny a name by way nearly always used by emperor i began almost from first day our association love admire her as i have loved her ever since always shall winter was very brilliant season culminating a famous ball costumes tsar alexis michailovitch who reigned seventeenth century ball was given first hermitage great art gallery adjoining winter palace but so immense was its success that it had be twice repeated once salle de concert palace again large ballroom schermetieff palace my sister i were two twenty young girls selected dance with twenty youthful cavaliers an ancient russian dance which required almost as much rehearsal as a ballet rehearsals were quite important society events all mothers attending empress often looking on as interested as any us that summer i again fell ill our villa peterhof i remember particularly that this was first time empress ever visited our house she drove a low pony chaise coming up my sickroom all white with a big white hat best spirits needless say her unexpected visit did me a world good as did her second visit at our home country when she left me a gift holy water from saroff a place greatly venerated by russians that winter with its artless pleasures pleasant summer which followed marked end an era russia immediately afterwards came catastrophe japanese war so needlessly entered into this war was beginning a long line disasters which ended supreme disaster i must confess that at time japanese war made no illustration empress driving her pony chaise peterhof illustration empress with grand duchess tatiana her bedroom tsarskoe selo favorite ikons background illustration alexander sergievitch tanieff director tsar s private chancellerie father anna viroubova very deep impression on young girls who like myself faced life lightly like happy children we resigned ourselves an almost complete cessation balls parties we put aside our pretty gowns for sober dress working sisters great salons winter palace were turned into workrooms there every day society flocked sew knit for our soldiers sailors fighting such incredible distances away as well as for wounded hospitals at home abroad my mother who was one heads committees giving out work be done at home was constantly busy we obediently followed her example every day empress came inspect work often sitting down at a table sewing diligently with others this was shortly before birth tsarevitch i have a clear picture my mind empress looking more than ever fine delicate her tall figure clad a loose robe dark velvet trimmed fur behind her chair bringing into splendid relief her bright gold hair stood a huge negro servant gorgeous scarlet trousers goldembroidered jacket white turban this negro jim was one four abyssinians who stood guard before doors private apartments they were not soldiers they had no functions except open close doors signify by a sudden noiseless entrance into a state apartment that one their majesties was about appear abyssinians were fact simply one leftovers from days catherine great whose times dwarfs negroes other exotics figured as a part court ceremonials they remained not because nicholas ii empress wanted them but because as i shall later explain it was practically impossible change any detail russian court life following summer heir was born amid wildest rejoicings all over empire i remember empress telling me with what extraordinary ease child was brought into world scarcely half an hour after empress had left her boudoir for her bedroom baby was born it was known that after many prayers there was an heir throne romanoffs emperor spite desperate sorrow brought upon him by a disastrous war was quite mad with joy his happiness mother s however was short duration for almost at once they learned that poor child was afflicted with a dread disease rather rare except royal families where it is only too common victims this malady are known medicine as haemophiliacs bleeders frequently they die soon after birth those who survive are subject frightful suffering if not sudden death from slight injuries blood vessels internal as well as external whole short life tsarevitch loveliest most amiable child imaginable was a succession agonizing illnesses due this congenital affliction sufferings child were more than equaled by those his parents especially his mother who hardly knew a day real happiness after she realized her boy s fate her health spirits began decline she developed a chronic heart trouble although boy s affliction was no conceivable way her fault she dwelt morbidly on fact that disease is transmitted through mother that it was common her family one her younger brothers suffered from it also her uncle leopold queen victoria s youngest son while all three sons her sister princess henry prussia were similarly afflicted one these boys died young other two were lifelong invalids everything possible everything known medical science was done for child alexei empress nursed him herself as indeed with assistance professional women she had nursed all her children three trained russian nurses were attendance with empress always superintending she bathed babe herself was with him so much that court ever censorious her complained that she was more a nurse than an empress court course did not immediately understand serious condition infant heir no parents be their estate high low are ready all at once reveal a misfortune such as that one it is always human hope that things are not as desperate as they seem that time some remedy for illness will be found emperor empress guarded their secret from all except relatives most intimate friends closing their eyes their ears growing unpopularity empress she was ill she was suffering but court she appeared merely cold haughty indifferent from this false impression she never fully recovered even after explanation her suddenly acquired silence melancholy became generally known chapter ii one earliest days my mother received a telegram from princess galatzine first lady waiting saying that my immediate presence at court was required princess orbeliani also a lady waiting was seriously ill some one was needed replace her attendance on her majesty i left at once for tsarskoe selo then as always favorite home imperial family on my arrival was conducted apartments palace known as lyceum rooms were small dark with windows looking out on a little church it was first time i had ever been away from home any surroundings i should have been homesick forlorn but these unfriendly surroundings my spirits were with some excuse depressed time my coming court was unpropitious imperial family all connections being deep mourning for grand duke serge who on morning february had been barbarously assassinated grand duke serge uncle nicholas ii had been governor moscow he was undoubtedly a reactionary his rule was said have been harsh certain it is that his administrative methods earned him intense enmity social revolutionaries he had long lived danger assassination his wife grand duchess elizabeth was devoted him spite his somewhat difficult temperament she never willingly allowed him leave palace kremlin unaccompanied usually she went with him herself but on this fatal february morning he being a dark mood left palace without her knowledge suddenly a great explosion shook all windows poor grand duchess springing from her chair cried out an agonized voice it is serge rushing out into court she saw a horrible sight body her husband scattered a hundred bleeding fragments over snow bomb had literally torn unfortunate man pieces so that dismembered mass flesh blood there was nothing recognizable what had been only a few minutes before a strong dominating man terrorist who threw bomb was promptly arrested tried sentenced death it was entirely characteristic grand duchess elizabeth that midst her grief horror she still found room her heart pity misguided wretch sitting his cell waiting his miserable end grand duchess insisted on visiting man prison assuring him her forgiveness praying for him on stone floor his cell whether not he joined her prayers i do not know social revolutionaries prided themselves on being irreligious very many them were jews court weighed down by this terrible tragedy was a sad enough place for a homesick girl like myself like all other ladies waiting i wore a black dress with a long veil when at length i was received by empress i found her too dressed deep mourning after this first formal reception i saw very little empress all her time being devoted her sister grand duchess elizabeth princess henry prussia who was visiting her empress dowager also came so that suite was thrown together what for me was not altogether a pleasant association my special duty as i discovered was attendance on old princess orbeliani whose illness i am bound admit did not sweeten her disposition but as she was dying that terribly trying malady creeping paralysis i am ashamed even now criticize her for other dames d honneur however i have no hesitation say that they were not on their best behavior being entirely a stranger at court unacquainted with insincerities which afterwards i came know only too well i suffered keenly from cutting remarks my colleagues my french which i own i spoke rather badly came for a great deal ridicule on whole it was rather an unhappy period my young life one bright spot that i remember was a drive with empress which i was summoned by telephone it was a warm day early spring snow around tree roots along road was thawing pale sunlight we drove an open carriage a big cossack picturesquely uniformed riding behind it was my first public appearance with royalty i was a little confused as how behave presence lowbowing crowds that lined way empress however soon put me at my ease chatting simple things talking her children especially infant heir at that time about eight months old our drive was not very long because empress had hurry back superintend a dancing lesson young grand duchesses i remember when i returned apartment invalid princess orbeliani she commented rather maliciously on fact that i was not invited attend dancing lesson but by that time alas i knew that had i been invited her comment might have been more malicious still still i must not speak badly poor princess for spite her illness approaching death she was very brave kinder than most people her circumstances would have been lent came on palace church there were held every wednesday friday special services for imperial family i asked was given permission assist these services i found great solace them at that time also i became warmly attached a maid honor grand duchess serge princess scnkovsky a woman rare character she had recently lost her mother was a sad mood almost everyone fact was sad at this time grand duchess serge although she bore her tragedy with dignity courage went about with a white face eyes which horror still lingered on religious holidays she laid aside her black robes appeared all white like a madonna princess irene prussia princess henry was still mourning for her little son who had died same incurable disease which afflicted tsarevitch she spoke me with emotion child whom she had been deeply attached my duty came an end holy week i went private apartments make my farewell empress she received me nursery baby tsarevitch her arms i cannot forget how beautiful child appeared how healthy normal he had a wealth golden hair large blue eyes an expression intelligence rare so young a child empress was kindness itself at parting she kissed me gave me as a souvenir my first service a locket set diamonds yet for all her gracious kindness how gladly i left that night for my beloved home following summer which as usual we spent at peterhof i saw much more empress than my month attendance on her with my mother sister i again worked daily workrooms established for wounded japanese war there almost daily empress came sew with other women once every week she visited hospitals at tsarskoe selo twice that summer at her request i accompanied her her foundation hospital for training nurses empress military hospitals was at her very best passing from bedside bedside speaking as tenderly as a mother sick suffering men sitting down a game checkers with convalescent officers it was difficult imagine how anyone could ever call her cold shy she was altogether charming as she passed all eyes followed her with love gratitude me she was everything that was good kind into my heart there was born a great emotion love loyalty that made me determine that i would devote my whole life service my sovereigns soon after i was know that they too desired that i should be intimately associated with their household first intimation came form an invitation spend two weeks on royal yacht which was about leave for a cruise finnish waters we left on small yacht alexandria at kronstadt transferred larger yacht polar star we were a fairly large company on board among others prince obolensky naval minister admiral birileff count tolstoy admiral chagin emperor s staff mademoiselle schneider myself attendance on her majesty a little my embarrassment i was placed at table next emperor with whom i was not at all acquainted it is true that i had often seen him at tsarskoe at peterhof riding walking with his kennel english collies eleven magnificent animals which he took great pride but this time on polar star was first time i had been brought into personal contact with him with empress i felt more at home this he knew for he began almost at once speak me her her great help him pain anxiety japanese war without her he said with feeling i could never have endured strain war was again recalled by a visit on board yacht from count witte fresh from portsmouth conference as a reward for his work done there he received for first time his title by which world now knows him during dinner he related with great gusto all his experiences united states his triumph over japanese delegates his popularity with americans appearing very happy satisfied with himself emperor complimented him warmly but count witte for all his talents was never a favorite with sovereigns life on board polar star was very informal very lazy agreeable we sailed through quiet waters baltic every day going ashore for walks emperor his staff sometimes shooting a little but more often spending time climbing rocks hunting mushrooms berries woods meadows playing with children whom this country holiday was heavenly pleasure living long hours open air indulging so much vigorous exercise made me desperately sleepy so that i found myself drowsy at dinner almost dead for sleep by time eleven o clock tea hour came round everyone found my drowsiness a source neverending amusement once after i had actually fallen asleep at tea had nearly pitched out my chair emperor presented me with a silver matchbox with which he said i might prop my eyes open until bedtime there was course a piano salon yacht empress i found a new bond our common love music we spent hours playing fourhand pieces all our dearly loved classics bach beethoven tschaikovsky others our quiet hours with our music especially before going bed empress i had many intimate conversations as if relieve a heart too much constrained silence solitude empress confided me freely difficulties her life from first day her coming russian court she felt herself disliked this was all more a grief mortification her because her marriage with emperor was a true love match she ardently desired that their union should increase russian people loyalty devotion they undoubtedly felt those days for house romanoff all stories reluctance alexandra feodorovna marry nicholas ii are absurdly untrue as a small child she had been taken petrograd marriage her older sister elizabeth grand duke serge with grand duchess xenia sister nicholas she formed a warm friendship with young heir himself she was on best terms one day he presented her with a pretty little brooch which from very shyness she accepted but afterwards repenting she returned squeezing gift into his hand course a children s party young tsarevitch much offended rather much hurt passed brooch on his sister xenia who not knowing its history cheerfully accepted it attraction so early established increased with years ripened into romantic love yet alexandra feodorovna hesitated accept nicholas as her betrothed because change religion which was necessary her home life at this time was not particularly happy her mother princess alice england had died her childhood now her father reigning grand duke hesse died suddenly a stroke paralysis her brother ernest who inherited title who was course her guardian had made an unhappy marriage with princess victoria coburg home life family was not particularly pleasant later this marriage was dissolved grand duke ernest was happily united princess eleanor sohmslich it was at his first marriage that alexandra feodorovna again met tsarevitch from this time on he became a suitor after their formal betrothal young

ill summer palace livadia crimea when his condition became hopeless alexandra feodorovna as future tsarina was summoned join imperial family at his bedside dying tsar rose from his sickbed dressed full uniform gave her greeting due her dignity as a royal bride from rest family unfortunately she had a less cordial reception empress her ladies waiting princess oblensky countess voronzoff were distant formal rest court as might be expected followed their example whole atmosphere palace seemed young girl unwholesome unsympathetic upstairs lay dying emperor while below suite lunched dined followed ordinary pursuits very much as though nothing untoward was happening alexandra feodorovna accustomed intimacy a small much less formal court this behavior seemed unfeeling unkind illustration military review near palace at tsaskoe selo end came suddenly one day when emperor at moment almost free from pain weakness was sitting his armchair empress marie quite overcome fainted arms alexandra who that hour extreme sorrow prayed sincerely that she her future motherinlaw might be drawn together bonds affection but this alas was never be days that followed were gray desolate for young bride funeral procession alexander iii wound slowly solemnly from crimea petrograd a journey many days young emperor absorbed his new duties had little time devote lonely homesick girl indeed they hardly met before morning their marriage a few days after state funeral dead emperor marriage took place church winter palace those who witnessed it have said that bride her rich satin robes looked very pale unhappy as she herself told me wedding seemed only a continuation long funeral ceremonies she had so lately attended thus came alexandra feodorovna russia nor did weeks that followed her arrival bring her any happiness her friend countess rantsau lady waiting princess henry prussia she wrote i feel myself completely alone i am despair that those who surround my husband are apparently false insincere here nobody seems do his duty for duty s sake for russia but only for his own selfish interests for his own advancement i weep i worry all day long because i feel that my husband is so young so inexperienced he does not at all realize how they are all profiting at expense state what will come it end i am alone most time my husband is all day occupied he spends his evenings with his mother this was true as nicholas was very inexperienced his mother s influence it must be said her knowledge affairs were very potent all during first year emperor two empresses lived together annitchkoff palace on nevski prospekt alexandra feodorovna comforted herself with thought that summer would bring her a real honeymoon crimea meanwhile she her young husband went for an occasional sledge ride together about only time granted them for confidences fortunately first baby came soon second was soon expected that autumn crimea emperor was stricken with typhus his wife insisted upon nursing him herself hardly permitting his personal servant assist her christmas was celebrated his sickroom his recovery having set some weeks before during these days convalescence they went on solitary walks together emperor began read with his wife confide her with affection when they went back petrograd it was with every cloud dispelled empress a radiantly happy wife however somewhat cold distant manner acquired first unhappy months her stay russia remained with her russia seemed her an unfriendly land she was never able present it her really sunny amiable disposition not all these confidences did empress impart me on that first cruise i was privileged share with her on polar star little by little then later i learned story her unhappy youth but what she told me that summer seemed relieve her mind she was more cheerful at ending cruise than at beginning commander yacht was good enough tell me that i had broken down wall ice that seemed surround her majesty that now she could be more easily approached at close voyage emperor said are go with us every year after this but dearest all my memory were words empress at parting dear annia god has sent me a friend so i remained ever afterwards not a courtier not long a lady waiting even a maid honor any capacity an official member court but merely a devoted an intimate friend alexandra feodorovna empress russia chapter iii shortly after our return peterhof i went abroad with my family stopping first at karlsruhe baden visit my grandmother afterwards going on paris empress had given me letters her brother grand duke hesse her eldest sister princess victoria battenberg both whom i saw before leaving germany seat grand duke hesse was wolfsgarten near darmstadt a beautiful place surrounded by extensive gardens laid out according grand duke s own plans after my first luncheon at palace during which grand duke asked me many questions about empress her life at court russia i walked gardens with mme grancy hofmistress court hesse a gracious charming woman she showed me toys other pathetic relics little princess elizabeth only child grand duke s first marriage who had died russia after an acute illness a few hours i also saw white marble monument which people hesse had raised memory child second luncheon i attended at old schloss came princess victoria battenberg with her lovely daughter louise etiquette at hesse was severest order i observed with some astonishment that princess victoria curtsied deeply her sisterinlaw princess eleanor who though much younger than herself was wife reigning grand duke old princess was a very clever woman a brilliant conversationalist although tell truth as she spoke very rapidly i lost a great deal what she said i remember her questioning me rather closely about political situation russia although i was not very enlightening on subject she was good enough invite me my sister lunch with her at jugenheim neighborhood darmstadt both brother sister empress entrusted me with letters her i took them with me paris not knowing that it would be a long time before i should be able deliver them for midst these pleasant days all unknown me tide trouble unrest was rising high russia beginning with a railroad strike finland a succession labor troubles revolutionary demonstrations extending over a large territory brought about a serious crisis which for a time tied up most railroads prevented our return russia cause trouble above all its ultimate consequences i must say that i remained complete ignorance that situation was grave course i realized my heart went out emperor on whom responsibility restoring order largely rested but that this railroad strike for that is all it seemed amount was beginning a revolution never crossed my mind i longed get back empress who i knew would be sharing anxiety emperor but as a matter fact i did not get back until after manifesto october had been signed delivered a startled world this october manifesto relinquishing principle autocracy creating for first time a duma empire was result many councils some them dramatic not say violent count witte grand duke nicholas were determined that emperor should sign manifesto a thing which he was reluctant do not because he clung his privileges as autocrat all russias though i know that this is motive still attributed him by almost all world tsar hesitated create a house popular representation because he knew how ill prepared russian people were for selfgovernment he knew dense ignorance masses fanatical illgrounded socialism intelligentsia doctrinaire theories constitutional democrats i can say with positive knowledge that nicholas ii fervently desired progress his country towards a high civilization but he felt very serious doubts wisdom radical changes russian system government at last however overborne by his ministers he signed manifesto it is said that grand duke nicholas one last councils lost all control himself drawing a revolver threatened shoot himself on spot unless manifesto was signed whether this actually occurred not i do not know but from what was told me later by empress scenes with grand dukes ministers were painful extreme when one final councils actual form national assembly was decided upon emperor with a hand trembling with emotion signed his name fateful document all room rose bowed him token their continued fidelity empress told me that while these trying scenes were progress she sat her boudoir alone save for her near relative grand duchess anastasie both whom felt that stormy council chamber a child was being dangerously brought into world yet all prayers empress as well as those emperor were that new policy popular representation would bring peace troubled russia duma was elected socialists alone political parties repudiating it as too bourgeois i was present with all empress s household throne room winter palace on opening day duma when tsar welcomed deputies i remember with what a strong steady voice with what clear enunciation opening speech was read proceedings first duma i have no very definite recollections because they were marked with endless very wordy discussions rather than with any attempt at constructive action everyone knows that duma was dissolved by imperial order after a short life two months these momentous political events which rocked russia were featured prominently every newspaper world only faint echoes reached inner circle russian court this may sound incredible readers republican countries where press is entirely uncensored where public opinion is educated politics russia reading public was a comparatively small one press was poorly representative really intelligent people empire few men fewer women my class attached any particular interest duma best we hoped for it being that time it would become an efficient working agency like parliaments western european countries adapted course russian needs first duma we thought only as a rather foolish debating society empress i were engaged at that time with singing lessons our teacher being mme tretskaia conservatoire empress was gifted with a lovely contralto voice which had she been born other circumstances might easily have given her a professional standing my voice being a high soprano we sang many duets sometimes my sister joined us as she also sang well we formed a trio singing many lovely arrangements for three voices by schumann others occasionally came also an english friend empress a talented violinist among us we arranged concerts which gave us greatest pleasure although we always had hold them another building palace called farm order not disturb emperor who for some strange reason did not like hear his wife sing when summer came while duma was talking out its brief existence we again took up our sea life this time on board large royal yacht standert we cruised for two months emperor frequently going ashore for tennis other amusements but occupied two days each week with papers state documents brought him by messenger from petrograd empress i were almost constantly together walking on shore sitting on deck reading watching joyful play children each whom had a sailor attendant keep them from falling overboard otherwise suffering mishap special attendant little alexei was a big goodnatured sailor named derevanko a man seemingly devoted child it was fact derevanko who taught alexei walk who during periods great weakness following severe attacks his malady carried boy most tenderly his arms all these sailors at end a cruise received watches other valuable presents from emperor yet most them even derevanko when revolution came turned on their sovereigns with meanest treachery on my days regular service wednesdays fridays for i was then a regularly appointed lady waiting i dined with imperial family at that time i formed a close friendship with general alexander orloff an old companion royal hussars with emperor after dinner emperor general orloff usually played billiards while empress i read sewed under warm lamplight those were happy evenings full bright talk laughter i came regard general orloff as one my best friends already hateful hand jealousy gossip had been directed against me by people who could not understand who from motives palace politics deliberately misunderstood empress s preference for my society practically every monarch has some close personal friend absolutely disassociated with politics social intrigue but i have noticed that these friendships are always misunderstood frequently bitterly resented i used take my small troubles general orloff at least they seem small now after years real trouble affliction but even after these bitter years sorrow affliction kindly counsels good old general often come back me as they did then like a friendly hand laid on my hot resentful heart i was then a fully grown mature young woman as i could not help knowing i was subject many conversations family circle because my indifference marriage i had i suppose normal amount attention from men usual number suitors but none young officers courtiers with whom i danced chatted made any special appeal my imagination there was one young naval officer alexander virouboff who after december came our house almost every day paying me most marked attentions one day at luncheon he spoke with pride very good service which he had just been appointed very soon afterwards i found myself greeted on all sides as his affianced february there was a ball which i was formally presented as a bride after whirl dinners presents new gowns jewels i began share excitement if not happiness those around me empress approved match my parents approved no one except my old friend general orloff expressed even a faint doubt wisdom marriage but on day when he spoke me frankly advising me think seriously before taking such a serious step empress entered room said a decided voice that i had given my word that therefore i should not be given any discouragement i was married on th april palace church at tsarskoe selo night before i slept ill early morning i awoke a mood sadness depression events day passed more like a dream than a reality as a dream i allowed myself be dressed my white satin wedding gown floating veil still a dream i knelt before their majesties who blessed me holding over my head a small ikon then began marriage procession through long corridors church first walked count fredericks master ceremonies court then came their majesties arm arm with my little boy cousin count karloff carrying a holy image then i walking with my father i must have shown by my excessive pallor anxiety i felt for on stairs empress looked at me with concern having caught my eye smiled brightly glanced upward reassuringly at bright sky during ceremony i stood quite still like a manikin gazing at my bridegroom as at some stranger i had one moment faint amusement when officiating priest who was very nearsighted mistook best man for bridegroom addressing us affectionately as my dear children empress as my matron honor stood at my left hand with four young grand duchesses two others children grand duke paul one these was grand duke dmitri who was destined grow up take part assassination rasputine on day my marriage he was just a dear little boy wideeyed with excitement being one a wedding party after ceremony there was tea with emperor empress as usual when she i parted there was an affectionate little note pressed into my hand how like an angel she looked me that day how hard it was for me turn away from her go away with my husband there was a family dinner that night our home petrograd afterwards we went away for a month into country it is a hard thing for a woman tell a marriage which from first proved be a complete mistake i shall say only my husband that he was victim family abnormalities which more than one instance manifested themselves madness my husband s nervous system had suffered severely rigors japanese war there were many occasions when he was not at all responsible for what he did often for days together he kept his bed refusing speak anyone one night things became so threatening that i could not forbear telephoning my fears empress she my joy responded by driving instantly house her evening gown jewels for an hour she stayed with me comforting me with promises that situation should one way another be relieved august emperor empress invited us both go for a cruise on standert sailing illustration emperor empress a quiet hour on board standert photograph by mme viroubova illustration empress distributing presents at end a cruise on imperial yacht standert through blue finnish fjords it did seem for a time that i should find peace but one day a terrible thing happened possibly an accident but if so a very strange one as we had on board an uncommonly able finnish pilot we were seated on deck at tea band playing a perfectly calm sea running when we felt a terrific shock which shook yacht from stem stern sent tea service crashing deck great alarm we sprang our feet only feel yacht listing sharply larboard an instant decks were alive with sailors obeying harsh commands captain helping suite look safety women children fleet torpedo boats which always surrounded yacht made speed rescue within a few minutes children their nurses attendants were taken off not knowing exact degree disaster empress i hastened cabins where we hurriedly tied up sheets all valuables we could collect we were last leave poor standert which by that time was stationary on rocks we spent night on a small vessel asia empress taking alexei with her one cabin emperor occupying a small cabin on deck little grand duchesses were crowded a cabin by themselves their nurses attendants finding beds where they could ship was far from clean i remember emperor rather disheveled himself bringing basins water empress me which wash our faces hands we had some kind a dinner about midnight none us passed an especially restful night next day came yacht alexandria on which we spent next two weeks a fortnight was required get illfated standert off rocks on which she had so mysteriously been driven from alexandria later polar star which we had been transferred we watched unhappy yacht being carefully removed from her captivity we had not been very comfortable on alexandria because there was not nearly enough cabin room for our rather numerous company empress occupied a cabin tsarevitch his sailor another one adjoining four little grand duchesses did as well as they could one small cabin while emperor slept on a couch main salon as for me i slept a bathroom most suite found quarters on a finnish ship which stood by after our return peterhof my husband became worse rather than better his physician advised him spend some time a sanatorium for nervous patients switzerland he left but on coming back russia was noticeably worse condition than before hope that active service would be benefit his shattered nerves disordered brain he was ordered sea but even this expedient proved little benefit after a year intense suffering humiliation my unhappy marriage with full approval their majesties my parents was dissolved i kept my little house tsarskoe selo its modest furnishings beautified by many gifts from empress among these gifts were some charming pictures six exquisitely embroidered antique chairs a silverladen tea table helped make salon cozy i have many happy memories intimate teas which empress sent fruit emperor cherry brandy which he especially affected little house however was far from being luxurious palace which i have often been pictured as living as a matter fact it was frightfully cold winter because house had no stone foundation but rested on frozen earth sometimes when emperor empress came tea we sat with our feet on sofa keep warm once emperor jokingly told me that after a visit my house he kept himself from freezing only by going directly a hot bath summer emperor empress paid an official visit england but on their return they sent for me again i spent a happy holiday on yacht not altogether happy however for towards end cruise my poor friend general orloff then near his death from tuberculosis came say goodbye his sovereigns correct his uniform all his orders fine old soldier bade us all a brave farewell before leaving for egypt where he well knew that his end awaited him peace his honored ashes he lies buried at tsarskoe selo where emperor empress often visited his grave poor orloff he too suffered from malicious gossip court where his honest admiration empress was deliberately misinterpreted assoiled i can bear witness i do that his greatest devotion was emperor his old comrade arms friend his youthful days chapter iv autumn i went for first time livadia country estate imperial family crimea this part russia dearer all tsars than any other is a small peninsula almost an island surrounded on west south by black sea on east by sea asov a range high hills protects it from cold winds north gives it a climate so mild bland as be almost subtropical imperial estate which occupies nearly half peninsula has always been left as far as possible its natural condition unbroken forests wild mountains valleys there was at time which i write but one short railroad whole crimea a short line running from sevastopol principal port black sea northward moscow all other journeys had be taken by carriage motor cars on horseback natural beauties crimea would be difficult exaggerate mountains dark with pines snowcovered during most year make an imposing background for profusion flowering trees shrubs vines making valleys plains one continuous garden vineyards crimea are were previous revolution equal any italy southern france what they became afterwards god knows but certainly up summer when i saw them last vineclad hills valleys crimea were an earthly paradise as lovely as peaceful as mind can picture from grapes crimea were distilled best wines russia among others an excellent champagne a delicious sweet wine muscat variety almost every kind fruit flourished valleys spring wealth blossoms pink white apples cherries peaches almonds made whole countryside a perfumed garden while autumn masses golden fruit were a wonder behold flowers bloomed as though they were very soul fair earth never have i seen such roses they spread over every building great vines as strong as ivy they scattered their rich petals over lawns pathways fragrance at times almost overpowering there was another flower glycinia which grew on trailing vines grapelike clusters deep mauve hue favorite color empress this flower too was intensely fragrant as were violets which spring literally carpeted plains imagine these valleys plains with their vineyards orchards their tall cypress trees trailing roses sloping down a sea as blue as sky as gentle as a summer day have a picture imperfectly as i have painted it country retreat romanoffs here all places russia they were loved revered natives peninsula were tartars men very tall strong women almost invariably handsome they were mohammedans it was only within late years that women had discarded their veils both men women wore very picturesque dress men wearing round black fur caps short embroidered coats over tight white trousers it was fashion for women dye their hair a bright red over which they wore small caps floating veils adorning themselves with a wealth silver bangles these tartars were an honest folk absolutely loyal tsar they were wonderful horsemen comparing favorably with best cossacks their horses through long breeding training were natural pacers see a cavalcade tartars sweep by was imagine a race centaurs come back earth so absolutely one was every horse man illustration livadia new palace tsars crime illustration a corner court new palace livadia crimea illustration imperial children bathing at livadia grand duke alexei on mme viroubovas kne background a farorite nurse palace as i saw it was a large old wooden structure surrounded by balconies rooms dark damp unattractive only really sunny cheerful room whole house was dining room where twice a day suite met for luncheon dinner emperor usually presided at these meals but empress being bad health lunched privately with tsarevitch empress had been for some time a victim most alarming heart attacks which she bravely concealed not wishing public know her condition oftentimes when i remarked blue whiteness her hands her quick gasping breaths she silenced me with a peremptory don t say anything people need not know however i was intensely relieved when at last she consented have daily attention a special physician this being devoted dr botkine who accompanied family their siberian exile shared their fate whatever that fate may have been dr botkine although a very able physician was not a man great social prominence when at empress s request i went apprise him his appointment as special medical adviser their majesties he received news with astonishment almost amounting dismay he began his administration by greatly curtailing activities empress keeping her quietly bed for long periods insisting on use a rolling chair gardens a pony chaise for longer jaunts abroad life at livadia after years was simple informal we walked rode bathed sea generally led a healthful country life such as tsar eminently an outdoor man a lover nature enjoyed utmost we roamed woods gathering wild berries mushrooms which we ate at our al fresco teas cooking mushrooms over little campfires twigs dried leaves emperor his suite hunted a little rode much played very good tennis this latter sport i was often emperor s partner a very serious affair i had make each game no conversation was allowed we played with all gravity intensity professionals we had each year many visitors came sometimes lunch

his own land he distributed presents true arabian nights profusion costly diamonds rubies their majesties suite orders decorations set with jewels nevertheless souvenir emir s visit livadia which i most prized was a photograph himself for which he obligingly posed gardens this photograph hundreds others which i took during twelve years i spent with imperial family i was obliged leave behind me when i fled a hunted refugee across russian frontier i have no hope ever seeing any them again th october anniversary death alexander iii was always remembered by a solemn religious service held room where he died armchair which he breathed his last being draped heavy black this death chamber was not main palace but a smaller house adjoining one which was used as a lodging for suite last part our stay crimea that year was not very gay emperor left us for an official visit king italy on day his departure empress greatly depressed shut herself up her own room refusing see anyone even children it was always her an intolerable burden that she emperor were obliged by etiquette part from each other public meet again after each absence full view suite often staring multitude this autumn was made sad also by one all too frequent illnesses unfortunate little tsarevitch sufferings child on these occasions were so acute that everyone palace was rendered perfectly miserable nothing much could be done assuage poor boy s agony nothing except constant love devotion empress gave him slightest relief we who could do nothing else for him took refuge prayer supplication little church near palace mlle tutcheva maid honor young grand duchesses read psalms while empress older girls olga tatiana two tsar s aides myself assisted singing midst our anxiety distress during this illness alexei my father paid us a brief visit bringing important reports emperor this was at least a momentary bright hour sorrow my existence at christmas time court returned tsarskoe selo both empress tsarevitch by this time much improved health next time i went with their majesties crimea we found estate transformed greatly beautified by substitution a palace white marble for ancient gloomy wooden buildings new palace was work eminent architect krasnoff who had also designed palaces grand dukes nicholas george two years krasnoff had indeed worked marvels not only palace which was a gem italian renaissance architecture but many smaller buildings whole constituting a town itself harmonious material design i shall never forget day we landed yalta glorious drive through bright spring sunshine palace before carriage rode an old tartar crimea one tribe i described earlier this chapter ride before tsar s carriage was an ancient prerogative these honest loyal people a prerogative which had be resigned when carriages gave way motor cars no tartar horse could have kept pace with much less have preceded a motor car nicholas ii for he always insisted on driving at a terrifying speed but as late as he kept up old custom driving from yalta livadia we drove as i say through dazzling sunshine under fresh green trees springtime until white palace set gardens blooming flowers vines burst on our delighted eyes russian fashion we proceeded first church from whence procession we followed priests anointing blessing new dwelling first day i spent with empress superintending hanging pictures ikons placing familiar homely objects photographs souvenirs so necessary make a dwelling place out an empty house even though it be a royal palace on second floor were private apartments family including a small salon apartments empress were furnished light wood pink chintzes many vases jars always kept full pink mauve flowers she loved from windows her boudoir one looked out on wooded hills from bedroom there was an enchanting view sparkling sea right empress s boudoir was emperor s study furnished green leather with a large writing table center room on this floor also was family dining room bedrooms tsarevitch grand duchesses their attendants a large day room for use children a big white hall ballroom seldom used below were rooms state drawing rooms dining rooms all white doors windows opening on a marble courtyard draped with roses vines which almost covered an antique italian well center court here emperor loved walk smoke after luncheon chatting with his guests with members household whole palace including rooms state were lightly beautifully furnished white wood flowered chintzes giving effect a hospitable summer home rather than a palace that autumn was marked by a season unusual gaiety honor coming age at sixteen grand duchess olga who received for occasion a beautiful diamond ring a necklace diamonds pearls this gift a necklace daughter a tsar when she became age was traditional but expense it alexandra feodorovna mother four daughters was a matter apprehension powerless change custom even had she wished do so she tried ease burden on treasury by a gradual accumulation jewels by her request necklaces instead being purchased outright when young grand duchesses reached age sixteen were collected stone by stone on their birthdays name days thus at comingout ball grand duchess olga she wore a necklace thirtytwo superb jewels which had been accumulating for her from her babyhood it was a very charming ball that marked introduction society oldest daughter tsar flushed fair her first long gown something pink filmy course very smart olga was as excited over her dbut as any other young girl her hair blonde abundant was worn for first time coiled up younglady fashion she bore herself as central figure festivities with a modesty a dignity which greatly pleased her parents we danced great state dining room on first floor glass doors courtyard thrown open music unseen orchestra floating from rose garden like a breath its own wondrous fragrance it was a perfect night clear warm gowns jewels women brilliant uniforms men made a striking spectacle under blaze electric lights ball ended a cotillion a sumptuous supper served on small tables ballroom this was a beginning a series festivities which grand duchess olga a little later on her sister tatiana enjoyed their utmost for they were not least like conventional idea princesses but simple happy normal young girls loving dancing parties all frivolities which make youth bright memorable besides dances given at livadia that year large functions attended by practically everyone neighborhood who had court entre there were a number very brilliant balls given honor olga tatiana after family returned tsarskoe selo two these were given by grand dukes peter george girls enjoyed them so much that they begged for another before christmas this time it was grand duke nicholas who provided a most regal entertainment preceded by a dinner for suite which i was invited i went because empress wished it but i went rather unwillingly knowing that atmosphere was not a friendly one their majesties were at that time particularly friendly with grand duke george his wife who was princess marie greece as formerly they had been with grand dukes peter nicholas their wives montenegran princesses melitza stana whom more must be written later on relating events coming age olga tatiana i must not forget mention affairs almost equal consequence which occurred crimea that season climate crimea was ideal for tuberculosis patients from her earliest married life empress had taken deepest interest many hospitals sanatoria which nestled among hills some them almost within confines imperial estate before beginning reign nicholas ii alexandra feodorovna these hospitals existed numbers but they were not best modern type not satisfied with these institutions empress out her own private fortune built equipped new improved hospitals one first duties laid on me when i first visited crimea was spend hours at a time visiting inspecting reporting on condition buildings nursing care patients i was particularly charged with discovering patients who were too poor pay for best food nursing one each summer s activities when family visited crimea was a bazaar other entertainment for benefit these needy ones four great bazaars organized largely managed by empress i particularly remember first these was held others for all these bazaars empress her ladies worked very hard from opening day empress however precarious condition her health always presided at her own table disposing fine needlework embroidery art objects with energy enthusiasm crowds around her booth were enormous people pressing forward almost frenziedly touch her hand her sleeve her dress enchanted receive their purchases from hand empress they adored for she was adored by real russian people whatever intriguing court jealous political rivals her husband thought her often crowd at these bazaars would beg for a sight alexei smiling with pleasure empress would lift him table where child would bow shyly but sweetly stretching out his hands friendly greeting worshipping crowds indeed people loved all imperial family then whatever changes were made minds many by horrible sufferings war by propaganda by mania revolution great mass russian people loved were loyal their sovereigns no one who knew them at all can ever forget that perhaps they were more universally loved crimea than elsewhere because simplicity their lives close touch they were able keep with people country we went livadia again last all spring summer we arrived last week lent i think saturday before palm sunday already fruit trees were full bloom air was warm with spring twice a day we attended service church on thursday holy week a very solemn day orthodox russian calendar their majesties took communion previously turning from altar congregation bowing on all sides after this they approached holy images kissed them empress her white gown cap looked beautiful if somewhat thin frail it was very sweet see little alexei helping his mother from her knees after each deep reverence on easter eve there was a procession with candles all through courts palace on easter sunday for two hours soldiers according old custom gathered exchange easter kisses with emperor receive each an easter egg children from schools came salute like manner empress for their majesties it was a long fatiguing ceremony but they carried it through with all graciousness while imperial household looked on such was intimate patriarchal relation between tsar his people such was real soul russia before revolution i have often read books written by western authors that tsar all imperial family lived hourly terror assassination that they knew themselves hated by their people were righteously afraid them nothing could possibly be farther from truth certainly neither nicholas ii nor alexandra feodorovna feared their people constant police supervision under which they lived annoyed them unspeakably never were they happier than when practically unattended they moved freely among russian people they loved connection with empress s care for tuberculosis patients crimea there was one day every summer known as white flower day on that day every member society unless she had a very good excuse went out into towns sold white flowers for benefit hospitals it was a day especially delightful empress as they grew old enough participate such duties all young grand duchesses empress her daughters worked very hard on white flower day spending practically whole day driving walking mingling with crowd vending their flowers as enthusiastically as though their fortunes depended on selling them all course they always did sell them all crowds surged around them eager proud buy a flower from their full baskets but buyers were no whit happier than sellers that i can say with assurance course life crimea was not all simplicity informality there were a great many visitors most them rank too exalted be treated with informality i remember particular visits grand duke ernest hesse brother empress his wife princess eleanor i remember also visits widowed grand duchess serge who had become a nun was now abbess a wonderful convent moscow house mary martha when she visited livadia masses were said daily palace church i ought not while speaking visitors omit mention old prince galitzin a very odd person but strongly attached tsar whom he presented a part his own estate some distance livadia which we made a special excursion on royal yacht another memorable excursion was estates prince oldenbourg on coast caucasia sea that day was very rough by time we reached our destination empress was so prostrated that she could not go ashore it was a pity because she missed what all others was a remarkable spectacle a grand holiday caucasians who their picturesque costumes crowded down shore greet their sovereigns whole countryside was festival great bonfires burning all hills on all meadows wild music most fascinating native dances such was life crimea old vanished days simple happy kind loyal all that was best russia chapter v these yearly visits crimea were diversified with holiday voyages on standert visits relatives close friends various countries their majesties visited riga other baltic ports where they were royally welcomed afterwards voyaging finnish waters where they received as guests king queen sweden this was an official visit hence attended with considerable ceremony exchange visits sovereigns from yacht warship state dinners receptions at one these dinners i sat next admiral swedish fleet who was much depressed because during royal salute emperor one his sailors had accidentally been killed autumn emperor empress went nauheim hoping that waters would have a beneficial effect on her failing health they left on a cold rainy day both were a melancholy state partly because separation from beloved home partly because quite apparent weakness empress on her account emperor showed himself deeply disturbed i would do anything he said me even going prison if she could only be well again this anxiety was shared by whole household even by servants who stood line on staircase saying their farewells illustration coming at yalta crimea emperor grand duchesses olga anastasie mme viroubova officers yacht standert photograph by empress illustration emperor grand duchesses olga marie strolling through homburg emperor out uniform was almost safe from recognition kissing shoulder emperor gloved hand empress i heard almost daily from frieberg where family were stopping letters from emperor empress children telling me their daily life at length came a letter from empress suggesting that i join my father at hombourg not far distant that we might have opportunity for occasional meetings as soon as i arrived i telephoned chteau at frieberg next day a motor car was sent fetch me i found empress improved health but looking thin tired from rather rigorous cure emperor his civilian clothes looked unfamiliar strange but he wore conventional citizen s garb because he as well as empress wished remain as far as possible private persons when health empress permitted she with olga tatiana enjoyed going unattended nauheim walking unnoticed through streets gazing admiringly into shop windows like ordinary tourists once emperor young grand duchesses motored over hombourg for a short hour walked about quite happily unobserved only too soon however emperor was recognized our whole small party was obliged flee precipitously before gathering crowds ever enterprising news photographers on some our outings emperor was more fortunate once when we were wandering along a country road on outskirts hombourg a wagon passing us dropped suddenly into road a heavy box carrier try as he would could not succeed lifting box back its place until emperor went forward exerting all his strength helped man out his difficulty carrier thanked his majesty with every expression respect gratitude recognizing him as a gentleman but never dreaming course his exalted station my expressions amused enjoyment situation emperor said me gravely i have come believe that higher a man s station life less it becomes him assume any airs superiority i want my children be brought up this same belief soon after this i returned russia visit my sister who had just borne her first baby a little girl named for grand duchess tatiana who acted as godmother for child my stay was not long as letters from empress called me frankfort order be near her on my arrival at frankfort a surprise awaited me form an invitation from grand duke ernest hesse stay with his imperial guests at his castle at castle gates i was welcomed by mme grancy charming hofmistress hessian court by miss kerr a bright clever english girl maid honor princess victoria miss kerr took me at once my apartments near her own i quickly made myself at home that night at dinner i sat between emperor our host grand duke hesse company which was most distinguished included prince henry prussia who that evening happened be rather a disagreeable mood princess irene princess victoria battenberg her beautiful daughter princess louise prince george greece two semiinvalid sons prince princess henry empress was not present being excused on account her cure besides it was understood that empress almost never appeared at state dinners grand duke hesse i have always liked extremely both for his amiable disposition for his many accomplishments he was is still an unusually gifted musician a painter an artist craftsman seriously interested great pottery darmstadt where his own designs are used he has always been a man liberal social ideals his popularity among people hesse not even german revolution has been powerful enough overthrow his wife princess eleanor when i knew her was dignified gracious gifted with a genuine talent for dress prince henry prussia brother kaiser brotherinlaw empress was a tall handsome man but inclined belet us saytemperamental at times he was overbearing very satirical at others friendly charming his wife was a small woman simple manner a kindly unselfish nature princess alice daughter princess victoria battenberg wife prince andrew greece was a beautiful woman but unhappily quite deaf castle frieberg which stands on a high hill overlooking a low valley little redroofed town nauheim is an ancient structure not particularly attractive either inside out there was nothing much for grand duke ernest s guests do way amusement except walk drive empress i saw rather less than we had planned but sometimes late evenings emperor empress myself met for russian tea for familiar talks before bedtime october november their majesties returned tsarskoe selo empress greatly benefited by her cure how happy we were be once more at home empress her charming boudoir hung with mauve silk fragrant with fresh roses lilacs i my own little house which i dearly loved even though floors were so cold opalhued boudoir empress where we spent a great deal our time was a lovely quiet place so quiet that footsteps children sound their pianos rooms above were often quite audible empress usually lay on a low couch over which hung her favorite picture a large painting holy virgin asleep surrounded by angels beside her couch stood a table books on lower shelf on upper a confusion family photographs letters telegrams papers it was undeniably a weakness empress that she was not least systematic about her correspondence intimate letters it is true she answered promptly but others she often left for weeks untouched about once a month madeleine principal maid empress would invade boudoir implore her mistress clear up this heap neglected correspondence empress usually began by begging be left alone but end she always gave importunities invaluable madeleine empress course had a private secretary count rostovseff but it was one her peculiarities that she preferred handle her letters telegrams before her secretary he seemed accustom himself with ease her dilatory ways it would be difficult imagine two people more widely different on points this kind than nicholas ii alexandra feodorovna their private apartments were very close together emperor s study billiard sitting room his dressing room with a fine swimming bath almost adjoining apartments empress big antechamber study well furnished with chairs tables many books magazines looked out on a court here people who had business with emperor waited until they were summoned his private room study was a perfect model orderliness big writing table having every pen pencil exactly its place large calendar also with appointments written carefully emperor s own hand was always precisely its proper place emperor often said that he wanted be able go into his study dark put his hand at once on any object he knew be there emperor was equally particular about appointments his other rooms dressing table whitetiled bathroom separated from sitting room by a corridor a small staircase was as much a model neatness as study table nor could emperor have tolerated valets who would not have kept his rooms a condition perpetual good order course ample garderobes where gowns wraps hats jewels empress innumerable uniforms emperor were kept were always order because they were care experienced servants were rarely if ever visited by others than their responsible guardians emperor s combined billiard sitting room was not very much used because emperor spent most his leisure hours his wife s boudoir but it was billiard room that emperor kept his many albums photographs records his reign these albums bound green with imperial monogram contained photographs taken over a period twenty years empress had her own albums full equally priceless records priceless from historian s standpoint at any rate each children had their own there was an expert photographer attached household whose only duty was develop print these photographs which were almost every case mounted by royal photographer s own hand this work used be done as a rule on rainy days either palace on board standert emperor as usual was neater about this work pasting photographic prints than any other member household he could not endure sight least drop glue on a table as might be expected so orderly a person emperor was slow about almost everything he did when empress wrote a letter she did it very quickly holding her portfolio on her knees on her chaise longue when emperor wrote a letter it was a matter hours before it was completed i remember once at livadia emperor retiring his study at two o clock write an important letter his mother at five empress afterwards told me letter remained unfinished private life imperial family these years before war was quiet uneventful empress never left her room before noon it being her custom since her illness read write propped up on pillows on her bed luncheon was at one o clock emperor his aidedecamp for day children an occasional guest attending after luncheon emperor went at once his study work receive visitors before tea time he usually went for a brisk walk open at half past two i came empress if weather was fine she well enough we went for a drive a walk otherwise we read worked until five when family tea was served tea was a meal which there was never slightest variation always appeared same little whitedraped table with its silver service glasses their silver standards for rest simply plates hot bread butter a few english biscuits never anything new never any surprises way cakes sweetmeats only difference imperial tea table came lent when butter even bread made with butter disappeared a small dish two nuts was substituted empress often used gently complain saying that other people had much more interesting teas but she who was supposed have almost unlimited power was reality quite unable change a single deadly detail routine russian court where things had been going on almost exactly same for generations same arrangement furniture state rooms same braziers incense carried by footmen long corridors same house messengers archaic costumes red gold with ostrichfeathered caps for all i know same plates for hot bread butter on same tea table were traditions going back catherine great peter farther still perhaps every day at same moment door opened emperor came sat down at tea table buttered a piece bread began sip his tea he drank every day two glasses never more never less as he drank he glanced over his telegrams newspapers children were only ones who found tea time at all exciting they were dressed for it fresh white frocks colored sashes spent most hour playing on floor with toys kept especially for them a corner boudoir as they grew older needlework embroidery were substituted for toys empress disliking see her daughters sitting with idle hands from six eight emperor was busy with his ministers he usually came directly from his study eight o clock family dinner this was never a ceremonial meal guests if any being relatives intimate friends at nine empress rich dinner gown jewels she always wore even on most informal evenings went bedroom tsarevitch hear him say his prayers tuck him into bed for night emperor worked until eleven until that hour empress two older grand duchesses i read had a little music otherwise passed time perhaps it is worth recording that bridge fact any other card games we never played nobody family cared at all for cards only a little once a while for dominoes at eleven evening tea was served after that we separated emperor write his diary for day empress children bed i for home all his life emperor kept a daily record events but like all private papers imperial family diaries were seized by revolutionary leaders probably although i still hope contrary destroyed diaries nicholas ii apart from any possible sentimental associations should be possessed great historical value monotonous though it may have been private life emperor his family was one cloudless happiness never all twelve years my association with them did i hear an impatient word surprise an angry look between emperor empress him she was always sunny sweetheart he came into her quiet room with its mauve hangings its fragrant flowers as into a haven rest peace politics cares state were left outside never were we allowed speak them empress on her part kept her own troubles herself never did she yield temptation confide him her perplexities foolish spiteful intrigues her ladies waiting nor even lesser troubles concerning education upbringing children he has whole nation think about she often said me only care she brought emperor was ever precarious health alexei but this whole family constantly felt it had be spoken very often imperial family was absolutely united love sympathy i like remember children who adored their parents that they never felt slightest resentment their mother s attachment for me sometimes i think little grand duchess marie who especially worshipped her father felt a little jealous when he invited me as he often did accompany him on walks palace gardens this may be imagination at all events child s slight jealousy never interfered with our friendship i think emperor liked walk with me because he had need talk someone he trusted purely personal cares which troubled his mind which he could share with few some these cares were old origin but had never been forgotten i remember once he began tell me almost without any preface dreadful disaster which attended his coronation a panic induced by bad management police course which scores people were crushed death at very hour this fatal accident coronation banquet took place emperor empress despite their grief horror were obliged take part it exactly as though nothing had happened emperor told me with what difficulty they had concealed their emotions often having hold their serviettes their faces hide their streaming tears one happiest memories my life at tsarskoe selo were evenings when emperor all cares past present forgot sat with us empress s boudoir reading aloud from work tolstoy tourgenieff his favorite gogol emperor read extremely well with a pleasant voice a remarkably clear enunciation years great war so full anguish apprehension emperor found relief reading aloud amusing stories averchenko teffy russian humorists who perhaps have not yet been translated into foreign tongues before war emperor was pictured far wide as a cruel tyrant deliberately opposed interests his people while empress appeared as a cold proud woman a malade imaginaire wholly indifferent public good both these pictures are cruelly misrepresentative nicholas ii his wife were human beings with human faults failings like rest us both had quick tempers not invariably under perfect control with empress temper was a matter rapid explosion equally sudden recovery she was often for moment furiously angry with her maids whom too often she discovered insincerities deceit emperor s anger was slower arouse much slower pass ordinarily he was kindest simplest men not least proud overconscious his exalted position his selfcontrol was so great that those who knew him little he often appeared absentminded indifferent fact is he was so reserved that he seemed fear any kind selfrevealment his mind was singularly acute he should have used it more accurately gauge characters persons surrounding him it was entirely within his mental powers sense atmosphere gossip calumny that surrounded court during last years certainly it was within his power put a stop idle malicious talk but it was rarely possible arouse him its importance what highminded person would believe such nonsense was his usual comment alas he little realized how few were really highminded people who last years empire surrounded his person that empress sometimes emperor found himself obliged take cognizance malicious gossip which made empress desperately unhappy end poisoned minds thousands really wellmeaning loyal russians beginning as far back as tide treachery had begun rise one earliest those responsible for final disaster i regret say was a woman highest aristocracy one long trusted affectionately regarded by imperial family mlle sophie tutcheff a protge grand duchess serge a lady who was a general overgoverness children was perhaps first all intriguing courtiers whom i have positive knowledge mlle tutcheff belonged one oldest most powerful families moscow she was strongly under influence certain bigoted priests especially that her cousin bishop vladimir putiata who for ten years had lived rome as official representative russian church it was he i firmly believe who inspired mlle tutcheff her antipathy empress her evil reports concerning life imperial family mlle tutcheff either her own accord encouraged by her relative was continually opposed what she called english upbringing imperial children she wished change whole system make it entirely slav free from any imported ideas mlle tutcheff was i believe first person create what afterwards became international rasputine scandal at time her residence palace at tsarskoe selo rasputine s influence had scarcely been felt at all by emperor empress although he was an intimate friend other members romanoff family but mlle tutcheff spread abroad a series most amazing falsehoods which rasputine figured as a constant visitor virtually spiritual guardian imperial family i do not wish repeat these stories but merely give an idea their preposterous nature i will say that she represented rasputine as having freedom nurseries even bedchambers young grand duchesses according tales purported have their origin with her rasputine was habit bathing children afterward talking with them sitting on their beds i do not think emperor believed all these rumors but he did believe that mlle tutcheff was guilty malicious gossip his family he therefore summoned her his study rebuked her severely asking her how she dared spread idle untrue stories about his children course she denied having done anything sort but she admitted that she had spoken ill rasputine but do not know man protested emperor any case if had criticisms make anyone known this household should have made them us not public mlle tutcheff admitted that she did not know rasputine when emperor suggested that before she spoke evil him it might be well for her meet him she haughtily replied never will i meet him for a short time after this mlle tutcheff remained at court but being a rather stupid very obstinate woman she continued her campaign intrigue she managed influence princess oblensky long a favorite lady waiting until she entirely estranged her from empress she even began speak children against their own mother until empress who felt herself powerless against woman actually refused visit nurseries when she wanted her children near her sent for them come her private apartments too well she knew emperor s extreme reluctance dismiss any person connected with court she waited silent pain until scandal grew such proportions that emperor could no longer ignore it then mlle tutcheff was summarily dismissed sent back her home moscow so powerful was influence tutcheff family that this incident was magnified beyond all proper proportions former overgoverness imperial children was represented as a poor victim rasputine a man whom she had never seen who probably never knew her existence last i ever heard mlle tutcheff who by way was a niece esteemed poet tutcheff she was living moscow under special protection bolshevik government her cousin former bishop vladimir putiata i understand has for several years been a great favorite those communists who have prosecuted such brave fearless opponents church despoilment as unhappy patriarch tikhon others emperor i think it ought be said that his education under his governor general bogdanovitch was calculated weaken will any boy encourage nicholas ii his natural reserve what might be called indolence mind but this i know him that after his marriage he became much more resolute temper much more gentle manner than other members his family it is certain that he loved russia russian people with his whole soul yet under political system for centuries force he had often leave people whom he knew only superficially many important details government unquestionably it was a fault emperor that he was overconfident only too ready believe what was told him by people whom he personally liked he was impulsive most his acts sometimes made important nominations on impression a moment it goes without saying that many his officials took advantage this overconfidence sometimes acted his name without his knowledge authority only too well for her own happiness peace mind did empress alexandra feodorovna understand her husband she knew his kind heart his love for his country his people but she knew also how easily influenced he could be by men whom he reposed confidence she knew that too often his acts were governed by last person he happened consult but for all this i wish say that emperor never appeared his friends as a weak man he had qualities leadership with very limited opportunities exercise those qualities his own domain he was every inch an emperor whole court from grand dukes down last petty official intriguing maid honor recognized this stood real awe their sovereign i have a keen recollection an episode at dinner which a certain young grand duke ventured utter an illfounded grievance against a distinguished general who had dared rebuke his highness public emperor instantly recognized this as a mere display temper egoism his contempt indignation knew no bounds he literally turned white with anger unfortunate young grand duke trembled before him like an offending servant afterwards still indignant emperor said me he may thank god that empress were present otherwise i could not have held myself hand towards end russian tragedy emperor had learned hold himself almost too well hand subdue conceal commanding personality which he was naturally possessed it would have been far better if he had used his personality his great charm manner offset tide intrigue revolution which midst a world war overcame empire as long as i knew him whether privacy palace at tsarskoe selo informal life crimea on imperial yacht public private i was always conscious strong personality emperor everybody felt it i can instance one occasion at a great reception tauride zemstvo when two men present were deliberately resolved behave a disrespectful manner emperor but moment he entered room these men found themselves completely overpowered their manner changed they showed every subsequent word action their shame regret at one time a group social revolutionaries were able put on a cruiser which emperor was visit a sailor charged with his sovereign s assassination but when opportunity came man literally could not do deed for his weakness this poor wretch was afterwards murdered by members his party character empress was quite different from that her husband she was less lovable many yet a stronger fiber where he was impulsive she was usually cautious thoughtful where he was overoptimistic she was inclined be a bit suspicious especially weak selfindulgent aristocracy it was generally believed that empress was difficult approach but this was never true sincere disinterested souls suffering always made a strong appeal empress whenever she knew anyone sad trouble her heart was instantly touched few people even russia ever knew how much empress did for poor sick helpless she was a born nurse from her earliest accession took an interest hospitals nursing quite foreign native russian ideas she not only visited sick herself hospitals homes but she enormously increased efficiency hospital system russia out her own private funds empress founded supported two excellent schools for training nurses especially care children these schools were founded on best english models were under general supervision famous dr rauchfuss head nurse miss puchkine a near relative great poet puchkine i could enlarge at length on many constructive philanthropies empress paid for by herself hospitals homes orphanages planned almost every detail by herself constantly visited inspected after japanese war she built a htel des invalides which hundreds disabled men were taught trades she also built a number cottages with gardens for wounded soldiers their families most these war philanthropies being under supervision a trusted friend colonel count shoulenbourg empress s favorite lancers empress possessed a heart a mind utterly incapable dishonesty deceit consequently she could never tolerate either other people this naturally got her heartily disliked by people society whom deceit was a matter long practice another quality condemned empress because entirely misunderstood was her care as expenses brought up comparative poverty a small german court empress never lost habit a cautious use money quite as private families where economy is an absolute necessity clothing young grand duchesses when outgrown by elders were handed down younger girls matter selecting gifts for guests for relatives at holidays for suite emperor simply selected from rich assortment sent palace objects which best pleased him empress on other hand always examined price cards considered before choosing whether jewel fur bijou whatever it was was worth what was asked for it difference between emperor empress regard money was a difference experience emperor all his life had had everything he wanted without ever paying a single ruble for anything he never had any money never needed any money i can recall but one solitary instance which tsar all russias ever even felt need touching a kopeck his illimitable riches it was when their majesties began attend services at feodorovsky cathedral at tsarskoe selo this church it was custom pass through congregations alms basins into which everyone course dropped a contribution large small emperor alone was entirely penniless embarrassed by his unique situation he made a representation proper authorities after which at exact monthly intervals he was furnished with four gold pieces for alms basin feodorovsky cathedral if he happened attend an extra service he had borrow his contribution from empress but if emperor carried no money his pockets it was well enough known that he commanded vast sums it was characteristic sycophants who surrounded him that he was constantly importuned for loans for money help out gambling otherwise impecunious officers who aware emperor s great love for army played on it their advantage one day when emperor was taking his usual brisk walk through grounds before tea a young officer who had managed conceal himself shrubbery sprang out threw himself on his knees threatened kill himself on spot unless emperor granted him a sum money clear desperate wretch some reckless deed emperor was frightfully enragedbut he sent man money demanded empress had always handled money knew quite well how spend it wisely from depths her honest soul she despised use money buy loyalty devotion for a long time after my first formal service as maid honor with usual salary i received from her majesty literally nothing at all from my parents i had income from my dowry four hundred rubles a month a sum entirely inadequate pay running expenses my small establishment with its three absolutely indispensable servants at same time dress myself properly as a member court circle empress s brother grand duke ernest hesse was one first her intimates point out her difficulties my position suggest her that i be given a position at court suggestion was not welcomed by alexandra feodorovna is it not possible for empress russia have one friend she cried bitterly she reminded her brother that her relation mine were not without precedent russia empress dowager had a friend princess oblensky also empress marie alexandrovna wife alexander iii had mme malzoff an intimate associate neither these women had had any court functions why should she not cherish a friendship free from all material considerations however after her brother also count fredericks minister court had pointed out her that it was scarcely proper that empress s best friend confidante should wear madeover gowns go home from palace on foot at midnight because she had no money for cabs empress began relent a little at first her change attitude took form useful gifts bestowed at christmas easter dress patterns furs gloves like finally one day she asked me discuss with her whole subject my expenses making me sit down with pencil paper she commanded me set forth a complete budget my monthly expenditures exactly what i paid for food service light fire clothing domestic budget apart from my small income came two hundred seventy rubles a month at orders empress i was thereafter furnished monthly with exact sum two hundred seventy rubles it never occurred her name amount round numbers three hundred rubles nor did it occur me except as a matter faint amusement course i was often embarrassed for money even after i became possessed this regular income even later when it was augmented by two thousand rubles a year for rent it often wrung my heart have say no appeals for money i knew that i appeared selfish hardhearted truth was that i was simply impecunious chapter vi year although destined end almost fatal illness tsarevitch began happily for imperial family peaceful busy were winter spring emperor engaged as usual with affairs empire empress as far as her health permitted superintending education her children all them busy with their books their various tutors education upbringing children nicholas ii empress alexandra feodorovna it should be said that while nothing was omitted make them most loyal russians educational methods employed were cosmopolitan they had french swiss english tutors but all their studies were under superintendence a russian highly cultured m petroff while for certain branches such as physics natural science they were privately instructed gymnasium tsarskoe selo first teacher imperial children she from whom they received their elementary education was miss schneider familiarly called trina a native one baltic states empire miss schneider first came into service years before marriage emperor empress as instructor russian language elizabeth grand duchess serge afterwards she taught russian young empress was retained at court as reader her majesty trina was rather a difficult person some ways taking every advantage her privileged position but she was undeniably valuable was heart soul her devotion family she accompanied them siberia there disappeared with them perhaps most valued instructors was m pierre gilliard whose book thirteen years at russian court has been published several languages has been very well received m gilliard a swiss gentlemen many accomplishments came first tsarskoe selo as teacher french young grand duchesses afterwards he became tutor tsarevitch m gilliard lived palace enjoyed fullest extent confidence affection their majesties mr gibbs english tutor was also a great favorite both these men followed family into exile remained faithful devoted friends until forcibly expelled by bolsheviki his book m gilliard has recorded that he was never able teach grand duchesses speak a fluent french this is true because languages used family were english russian children never became interested any other languages trina was supposed teach them german but she had less success with that language than m gilliard with french emperor empress spoke english almost exclusively so did empress s brother grand duke hesse his family among themselves children usually spoke russian tsarevitch alone thanks his constant association with m gilliard mastered french language every detail education her children was supervised by empress who often sat with them for hours together schoolroom she herself taught them sewing needlework her best pupil being tatiana who had an extraordinary talent for all kinds handwork she not only made beautiful blouses other garments embroideries crochets but she was able on occasions arrange her mother s long hair dress her as well as a professional maid not that empress required as much dressing as ordinary woman rank wealth she had that kind victorian modesty that forbade any intrusion on privacy her dressing room all that her maids were allowed do was dress her hair fasten her boots put on her gown jewels empress had great taste dress always chose her jewels finish rather than ornament her costumes only rubies today she would command pearls sapphires with this gown illustration empress giving a lesson alexei on terrace at livadia illustration alexei playing snow at tsarskoe selo illustration empress alexeis bed during convalescence from a serious illness empress children have been represented as surrounded by german servants but this accusation is absolutely false chief woman household was mme geringer a russian lady who came daily palace ordered gowns did all necessary shopping paid bills attended any business required by empress chief maid empress was madeleine zanotti english italian parentage whose home before she came tsarskoe selo was england madeleine was a woman middle age very clever as usual with one her position inclined be tyrannical madeleine had charge all gowns jewels empress as i think i have related she was often critical her mistress s indolent habits regard correspondence etc a second maid was tutelberg toodles a rather slow quiet girl from baltic she madeleine were mortal enemies but they agreed on one thing at least that was that they would not wear caps aprons empress goodnaturedly acquiesced permitted simple black gowns ribbon bows hair for her chief maids there were three under maids all russians all perfectly devoted imperial family these girls who wore regulation caps white aprons cared for rooms empress children all maids when revolution came remained faithful family one them as i shall tell later performed dangerous service smuggling letters out siberia one girl anna demidoff shared fate family emperor had three valets one whom shalferoff who had served alexander iii turned spy during revolution another old raziesh also a former servant alexander iii died service nicholas ii was replaced by chemoduroff a fine very loyal man third valet s name was katoff all three as their names testify were russians as were also three men service empress leo kondratief both whom died during early days revolution volkoff who followed royal exiles as far into siberia as he was permitted by provisional government children s nurses were russians head nurse being marie vechniakoff others i remember well were alexandra nicknamed shoura a great favorite with girls anna lisa kind faithful girls who spoke no word any language except russian there were course hundreds house servants my knowledge most if not all them were russians chef was a frenchman cubat a very great man his profession sometimes when an especially splendid dish had been prepared cubat was wont introduce it as it were by standing magnificently doorway clad immaculate white linen until dish was served cubat became very wealthy tsar s service now lives happily luxuriously his native france he was i believe truly loyal imperial family which is more than can be said for most servants their children were educated at expense emperor majority instead choosing useful trades elected go universities where they nearly all became revolutionists my father s opinion this was due fact that russian universities higher schools offered little if any technical training recognizing this empress created petrograd a technical school for boys girls whole empire this school students were trained become teachers many useful handicrafts addition this normal academy empress established many governments schools where boys girls were perfected beautiful peasant arts embroidery dyeing carving painting i give these details because i think it only just offset with facts lying slanders sensational writers who could not possibly have known anything intimate life imperial family russia but who have substituted propaganda for truth none these sensational writers knew tried know how simple not say rigorous was rgime followed by imperial children all them even delicate little tsarevitch slept large wellaired nurseries on hard camp beds without pillows with least possible allowance bedclothing they had cold baths every morning warm ones only at night as a consequence this simple life their manners were unassuming natural without a single trace hauteur although four girls were rapidly approaching womanhoodolga was her eighteenth year tatiana was nearly sixteentheir parents continued regard them as children two older girls were spoken as big ones were given many grownup privileges as for example concerts theater which emperor himself escorted them two younger grand duchesses tsarevitch little ones were still nursery darkness mystery which surrounds fate these innocent children it is with poignant emotion that i recall them as they appeared so full life joy those distant yet incredibly near days before world war downfall imperial russia four girls olga marie were essentially russian altogether romanoff their inheritance olga was perhaps cleverest them all her mind being so quick grasp ideas so absorbent knowledge that she learned almost without application close study her chief characteristics i should say were a strong will a singularly straightforward habit thought action admirable qualities a woman these same characteristics are often trying childhood olga as a little girl sometimes showed herself wilful even disobedient she had a hot temper which however she early learned keep under control had she been allowed live her natural life she would i believe have become a woman influence distinction extremely pretty with brilliant blue eyes a lovely complexion olga resembled her father fineness her features especially her delicate slightly tipped nose illustration grand duchesses olga tatiana on board standert

was inclined be stout she had rather thick lips which detracted a little from her beauty marie had a naturally sweet disposition a very good mind all three these girls were more less tomboy type they had something innate brusqueness their romanoff ancestors which displayed itself a tendency mischief anastasie a sharp clever child was a very monkey for jokes some them at times almost too practical for enjoyment others i remember once when family was their polish estate winter children were amusing themselves at snowballing imp which sometimes seemed possess anastasie led her throw a stone

alexei gardens tsarskoe selo at her dearly loved sister tatiana missile struck poor girl fairly face with such force that she fell senseless ground grief horror anastasie lasted for many days permanently cured her her worst propensities practical jokes tatiana was almost a perfect reincarnation her mother taller slenderer than her sisters she had soft refined features gentle reserved manners her english ancestry kindly sympathetic disposition she displayed towards her younger sisters her brother such a protecting spirit that they fun nicknamed her governess all grand duchesses tatiana was with people most popular i suspect their hearts she was most dearly loved her parents certainly she was a different type from others even appearance her hair being a rich brown her eyes so darkly gray that evening they seemed quite black all girls tatiana was most social her tastes she liked society she longed pathetically for friends but friends for these high born but unfortunate girls were very difficult find empress dreaded for her daughters companionship oversophisticated young women aristocracy whose minds even schoolroom were fed with foolish often vicious gossip a decadent society empress even discouraged association with cousins near relatives many whom were unwholesomely precocious their outlook on life i would not give impression that these young daughters emperor empress were forced lead dull uneventful lives they were allowed have their little preferences for this that handsome young officer with whom they danced played tennis walked rode these innocent young romances were fact a source amusement their majesties who enjoyed teasing girls about any dashing officer who seemed attract them grand duchess olga sister emperor sympathized with her nieces love pleasure often arranged tea parties tennis matches for them guests course being their own choice we had some quite jolly tea parties my little house also matter dress so important young pretty girls grand duchesses were allowed indulge their own tastes mme brisac an accomplished french dressmaker made gowns for imperial family through her latest paris models reached palace girls however inclined towards simple english fashions especially for outdoor wear summer they dressed almost entirely white jewels they were too young wear except on very great occasions each girl received on her twelfth birthday a slender gold bracelet which was afterwards always worn day night for good luck i have described a previous chapter russian custom presenting each grand duchess on her coming age with a pearl diamond necklace but this was worn only at state functions very formal balls alexei only son emperor empress a more tragic child than last dauphin france indeed one most tragic figures history was apart from his terrible affliction loveliest most attractive whole family because his delicate health alexei began life as a rather spoiled child his chief nurse marie vechniakoff a somewhat overemotional woman made mistake indulging child every whim it is easy understand why she did so because nothing more heartrending could be imagined than little boy s moans cries during his frequent illnesses if he bumped his head struck a hand foot against a chair table usual result was a hideous blue swelling indicating a subcutaneous hemorrhage frightfully painful often enduring for days even weeks at five alexei was placed charge sailor derevanko who for a long term years remained his constant body servant companion derevanko while devoted boy did not spoil him as his women nurses had done man was so patient resourceful that he often did wonders alleviating child s pain i can still memory hear plaintive suffering voice alexei begging big sailor lift my arm put my leg up warm my hands i can see patient calmeyed man working for hours on end give maximum comfort little painracked limbs as alexei grew older his parents carefully explained him nature his illness impressed on him necessity avoiding falls blows but alexei was a child active mind loving sports outdoor play it was almost impossible for him avoid very things that brought him suffering can t i have a bicycle he would beg his mother alexei know can t mayn t i play tennis dear know mustn t often these hard denials natural play impulse were followed by a gush tears as child cried out why can other boys have everything i nothing suffering selfdenial had their effect on character alexei knowing what pain sacrifice meant he was extraordinarily sympathetic towards other sick people his thoughtfulness others was shown his beautiful courtesy women girls his elders his interest troubles servants dependents it was a failing emperor that even when he sympathized with troubles others he was rather slow take action unless indeed matter was really serious alexei on contrary was always for immediate action i remember an instance when a boy service at palace was discharged for some reason which i have quite forgotten story somehow reached ears alexei who immediately took sides with boy gave his father no rest until whole case was reviewed culprit was forgiven restored duty alexei usually defended all offenders yet when day came when his parents deep distress told him that father gregory that is rasputine had been killed by members his own family boy s grief was swallowed up rage indignation papa he exclaimed is it possible that will not punish them assassins stolypine were hanged i ask reader remember that imperial family firmly believed that they owed much alexei s improving health prayers rasputine alexei himself believed it several years before rasputine had assured empress that when boy was twelve years old he would begin improve that by time he was a man he would be entirely well undeniable fact is that after age twelve alexei did begin very materially improve his illnesses became farther farther apart before his appearance had changed marvelously for better he resembled no way invalid sons his mother s sister princess henry prussia who suffered from his own terrible malady what best physicians europe had been unable do their case some mysterious force had done case tsarevitch his parents whom young boy was as their very heart s blood believed that healing hand god had wrought cure that it was answer supplication one whose spirit was able rise higher flight than theirs any other s they knew course that boy was not yet entirely well but they believed that he was getting well alexei believed this also it is certain that he looked forward a healthy normal manhood alexei like his father dearly loved army all pageants military display he had every kind toy soldier toy guns fortresses with these he played for hours with his sailor companion derevanko dina as boy called him with few boy companions he was allowed two these boys were sons dina a third was son one family physicians by coincidence also named derevanko last years before revolution a few carefully selected boys cadets from military school were called palace play with alexei these boys were warned danger any rough play all were extremely mindful their responsibility it was because no other type boy could be trusted play with alexei that empress did not often invite palace children grand dukes they were romanoffs brusque rude their manners thoughtless feelings others empress literally did not dare leave them alone with her son but because her caution she was bitterly assailed by her enemies who spoke sneeringly her preference for low born children over aristocratic children family emperor empress all children were passionately fond pets especially dogs emperor s inseparable companion for many years was a splendid english collie named iman when natural course time this dog died emperor was inconsolable after that he had a fine kennel collies but he never made a special pet any dog favorite dog empress was a small shaggy terrier from scotland this dog s name was eira tell truth i did not like little animal at all his disagreeable habit darting from under chairs snapping at people s heels was a trial my nerves nevertheless empress doted on him carried him under her arm even dinner table amused herself greatly talking playing with dour little creature when he fell ill had be mercifully killed she wept real grief pity alexei s pets were two a silky little spaniel named joy a beautiful big gray cat gift general voyeikoff it was only cat household it was a privileged animal even being allowed sleep on alexei s bed there were two other dogs tatiana s french bull a little king charlie which i contributed menagerie both these dogs went with family siberia jimmie king charles spaniel was found shot death that dreadful deserted house ekaterinaburg how far how unbelievably far away now seem those peaceful days when we were watching tsar s daughters growing towards womanhood even our minds speculating on possible marriages for them their prospects as far as marriage was concerned i must say were rather vague foreign matches because religion even more because girls devotion home country were almost out question suitable husbands russia seemed be entirely lacking there was a time his boyhood when dmitri son tsar s uncle grand duke paul was a great favorite with imperial family but dmitri as he grew older became so dissipated that he quite cut himself off from prospect an alliance with any grand duchesses there had once been a faint possibility an engagement between olga crown prince carol rumania as early as beautiful queen marie her son visited russia for purpose introducing young people but nothing came visit family made a return visit rumania on standert rumanian royal family including old queen carmen sylva meeting yacht at constanza on black sea making a splendid fte which lasted for three days this time matter was seriously broached olga who her usual quick straightforward manner declined match prince carol again visited russian court now his young man s fancy rested on marie he made a formal proposal for her hand but emperor declaring that marie was nothing more than a schoolgirl goodnaturedly laughed prince s proposal aside not all these proposals ended so merrily one day coming as usual peterhof i found empress tears a formal proposal had just been received from old grand duchess marie pavlovna aunt emperor for a marriage between her son boris vladimirovitch grand duchess olga this young man prince boris was much better known questionable circles paris than court russia mere suggestion a marriage with one her daughters was enough reduce empress mortified tears course proposal was rejected greatly wrath grand duchess marie pavlovna a russian grande dame old school which debauchery young men was regarded as a perfectly natural phenomenon she never forgave slight as she chose consider it later became one most active circle intriguers which from safety a foreign embassy petrograd plotted ruin imperial family their country summer family their immediate household including myself went on another long cruise finnish waters during cruise yacht was visited by empress dowager whom previously i had seen but little i write with some hesitation about empress dowager who is still living for whom i entertain all due respect she was as i remember her then a small slender woman not beautiful certainly not as attractive as her sister queen alexandra england but with a great deal presence when she chose exert it considerable personal charm emperor she apparently loved less than her other children especially her son grand duke michail empress i fear she loved not at all children she was affectionate but a trifle distant i am sure that she resented fact that first four children were girls there is little doubt that she felt bitterly affliction heir possibly she felt her secret heart that it should have been her own strong son michail who was acknowledged successor nicholas ii i say this from my own conjecture observations not from positive knowledge yet after events i think confirmed my opinion dowager empress after death alexander iii relinquished with rather bad grace her position reigning empress fact she never did relinquish it altogether always taking precedence on public occasions alexandra feodorovna just why tsar consented this i never knew but certain it is that always when imperial family made a state entrance tsar appeared first with his mother on his arm empress following on arm one grand dukes society generally approved this procedure empress mother enjoying all popularity which empress lacked there were actually russia two courts a large one represented by society grand dukes a small one represented by intimate circle emperor empress one everything done by empress mother was right by shy retiring empress wrong small court it was exactly other way around except that even palace a certain amount petty intrigue always existed visit finnish waters by empress mother was marred by no coldness disharmony when we went ashore for tennis emperor admonished us all play as well as we could because mama is coming we lunched aboard her yacht she dined with us on standert on d july which was her name day as well as that little grand duchess marie she spent most day on emperor s yacht after luncheon i took a photograph her sitting with her arm around emperor s shoulders her two little japanese spaniels at their feet she made us dance for her on deck photographing us as we danced after tea children performed for her a little french playlet which seemed delight her yet that evening at dinner i could not help noticing how her fine eyes so kind smiling towards most company clouded slightly whenever they were turned emperor empress still i must record that later passing open door alexei s cabin i saw empress mother sitting on edge child s bed talking gaily peeling an apple quite like any loving grandmother i do not pretend understand empress dowager her motives but as far as i can judge her chief weakness was love power she carried her insistence on precedence so far that chiffres maids honor both empresses bore initials m a instead a m which was proper order she wanted be first everything could not bear abdicate either power influence she never i believe understood her son s preference for a quiet family life changed softened manners he acquired under influence his wife chapter vii autumn family went skernevizi their polish estate order indulge emperor s love for biggame hunting vast forests surrounding estate all kinds game were preserved sport hunting there was said be very exciting during war these woods all game were destroyed by germans but until after skernevizi was a favorite retreat emperor i had returned my house tsarskoe selo but i was not allowed long remain there a telegram from empress conveyed disquieting news that alexei jumping into a boat had injured himself was now a serious condition child had been removed from skernevizi spala a smaller polish estate near warsaw warsaw i accordingly traveled here i was met by one imperial carriages was driven spala driving for nearly an hour through deep woods over a heavy sandy road i reached my destination a small wooden house something like a country inn which suite was lodged two rooms had been set apart for me my maid here i found olga tatiana waiting help me get settled their mother they said was expecting me without any loss time i went with them palace i found empress greatly agitated boy was temporarily improved but was still too delicate be taken back tsarskoe selo meanwhile family lived one dampest gloomiest palaces i have ever seen it was really a large wooden villa very badly planned as far as light sunshine were concerned large dining room on ground floor was so dark that electric lights had be kept on all day upstairs right a long corridor were rooms emperor empress her sitting room bright english chintzes being one few cheerful spots house here we usually spent our evenings bedrooms dressing rooms were too dark for comfort but emperor s study also on right corridor was fairly bright as long as health little alexei continued fairly satisfactory emperor his suite went stag hunting daily forests estate every evening after dinner slain stags were brought front palace laid out for inspection on grass huntsmen with their flaring torches winding horns standing over day s bag made i was told a very picturesque spectacle emperor his suite most household used enjoy going out after dinner enjoy this fine sight i never went myself having a foolish love animals which prevents enjoyment royal sport hunting i even failed appreciate as head estate kind count velepolsky thought i should many trophies chase with which corridors apartments palace were adorned what i did enjoy was beautiful park which surrounded palace rapid little river pilitsa that flowed through it there was one leafy path through which i often walked mornings with emperor this was called road mushrooms because it ended a wonderful mushroom bench whole place was so remote peaceful that i deeply sympathized with their majesties irritation that even there they could never stir abroad without being haunted by police guard although alexei s illness was believed have taken a favorable turn he was even beginning walk a little about house gardens i found him pale decidedly out condition he occasionally complained pain but doctors were unable discover any actual injury one day empress took child for a drive before we had gone very far we saw that indeed he was very ill he cried out with pain his back stomach empress terribly frightened gave order return palace that return drive stands out my mind as an experience horror every movement carriage every rough place road caused child most exquisite torture by time we reached home he was almost unconscious with pain next weeks were endless torment boy all us who had listen his constant cries pain for fully eleven days these dreadful sounds filled corridors outside his room those us who were obliged approach had often stop our ears with our hands order go about our duties during entire time empress never undressed never went bed rarely even lay down for an hour s rest hour after hour she sat beside bed where halfconscious child lay huddled on one side his left leg drawn up so sharply that for nearly a year afterwards he could not straighten it out his face was absolutely bloodless drawn seamed with suffering while his almost expressionless eyes rolled back his head once when emperor came into room seeing his boy this agony hearing his faint screams pain poor father s courage completely gave way he rushed weeping bitterly his study both parents believed child dying alexei himself one his rare moments consciousness said his mother when i am dead build me a little monument stones wood family s most trusted physicians dr rauchfuss professor fedoroff his assistant dr derevanko were charge case after first consultations declared tsarevitch s condition hopeless hemorrhage stomach from which he was suffering seemed liable turn into an abscess which could at any moment prove fatal we had two terrible moments which this complication threatened one day at luncheon a note was brought from empress emperor who pale but collected made a sign for physicians leave table alexei empress had written was suffering so terribly that she feared worst was about happen this crisis however was averted on second occasion on an evening after dinner when we were sitting very quietly empress s boudoir princess henry prussia who had come be with her sister her trouble appeared doorway very white agitated begged members suite retire as child s condition was desperate at eleven o clock emperor empress entered room despair written on their faces still empress declared that she could not believe that god had abandoned them she asked me telegraph rasputine for his prayers his reply came quickly little one will not die it said do not allow doctors bother him too much as a matter fact turning point came a few days later pain subsided boy lay wasted utterly spent but alive curiously enough there was no church on this polish estate but during illness tsarevitch a chapel was installed a large green tent garden a new confessor father alexander celebrated mass after first celebration he walked solemn procession from altar sickroom bearing with him holy communion for sick boy emperor empress were very much impressed with father alexander from that time on they retained him their private chapel at tsarskoe selo he was a good man but not a brave one for when revolution came emperor empress sent for him come them he confessed himself afraid go poor man his caution after all did not save him he was shot by bolsheviki a year two afterwards on what pretext i do not know convalescence alexei was slow wearisome his nurse marie vechniakoff had grown so hysterical with fatigue that she had be relieved while empress was so exhausted that she could hardly move from room room young grand duchesses were tireless their devotion poor invalid as was also m gilliard who read him diverted him hours on end gradually distracted household assumed a more normal aspect emperor cossack uniform began once more entertain officers his varsovie lancers commanded by a splendid soldier general mannerheim whom world has heard much as alexei s health continued improve there was even a little shooting a great deal tennis which girls after their long confinement house greatly enjoyed all us began be happy again but one day emperor called me into his study showed me a telegram from his brother grand duke michail which latter announced his morganatic marriage countess brassoff whom emperor strongly disapproved it was not marriage itself that so strongly disturbed emperor but that michail had solemnly given his word honor that it would never take place he broke his wordhis word honor emperor repeated again again another blow which emperor received at this time was suicide admiral chagin commandant standert one closest friends family admiral shot himself on account an unhappy love affair deeply as emperor mourned his death he was even more indignant at manner it russians i know are inclined morbidity suicide with them is not an uncommon thing but nicholas ii always regarded it as an act dishonor running away from field battle was his characterization such an act when he heard chagin s suicide he gave way a terrible mood anger grief speaking both michail chagin he said bitterly how midst boy s illness all our trouble how could they have done such things poor emperor whom every failure those he loved trusted came as an utterly unexpected blow how near was his hour complete final disillusionment nearly all earthly loyalties we had a few weeks peaceful enjoyment before leaving spala that autumn girls bright happy once more rode every morning crisp air exercise coloring their cheeks raising their spirits high emperor tramped woods sometimes with me as his companion on one these outings we both had a narrow escape from drowning emperor took me for a row on river which as i have said had a very rapid current intent on keeping boat well into current emperor ran us into a small island for a few seconds escape from an ignominious upset seemed impossible i was thoroughly frightened emperor not a little embarrassed ardor for water sports was for a time rather lessened both us on october russian calendar we celebrated accession throne with high mass holy communion a few days later doctors decided that alexei was well enough be moved tsarskoe selo imperial train was made ready their majesties decided that i was travel on it with rest suite this was as a matter fact contrary strict etiquette announcement created among ladies waiting much consternation not say rancor there is no question that being a regularly appointed lady waiting royalty having nothing do when a mere friend exalted one happens be at hand is a bit irritating so i cannot really blame empress s ladies for objecting me as a traveling companion imperial train now used one hears by inner circle communists was composed a number luxurious carriages more like a home than a railway train carriage emperor empress easy chairs sofas were upholstered bright chintz there were books family photographs all sort familiar trinkets emperor s study was his favorite green leather adjoining their dressing rooms was a large perfectly equipped bathroom this carriage also were rooms for personal attendants their majesties grand duchesses their maids had a similar carriage alexei s carriage which had compartments for maids honor myself was furnished with every imaginable comfort last carriage was dining wagon with a small anteroom where inevitable zakouski russian table hors d uvres was served at long dining table emperor sat with his daughters on either hand while facing him were count fredericks ladies waiting throughout journey nearly two days empress was served her own room beside bed where alexei lay very weak but bright cheerful once more this chapter may well close with one opening events jubilee romanoffs celebrating three hundredth anniversary their reign february court moved from tsarskoe selo winter palace petrograd a place they disliked because vast gloominess building fact that only garden was a tiny space hardly large enough for children play exercise on reaching petrograd family drove directly across neva christ s chapel little church peter great where is was preserved a miraculous picture christ very old highly revered public had not been notified that imperial family would first visit this chapel but their presence quickly became known they drove back winter palace through excited but on whole undemonstrative masses people a typical petrograd crowd actual celebration jubilee began with a solemn service cathedral our lady kazan which everyone familiar with petrograd remembers as one most beautiful russian churches vast building was packed its utmost capacity that means a much larger crowd than ordinary churches since russia congregation stands kneels through entire service from my position i had a very good view both emperor tsarevitch i was puzzled see them raise their heads gaze long at ceiling but afterwards they told me that two doves had appeared had floated for several minutes over their heads religious exaltation hour this appeared emperor a symbol that blessing god after three illustration emperor empress old slavonic dress jubilee illustration invalid empress on her balcony at peterhof centuries continued rest on house romanoff there followed a long series functions at palace with deputations coming from all over empire women appearing at receptions dinners beautiful national dress which were also worn by empress her daughters empress for all her weariness was regal her richly flowing robes longveiled high kokoshnik russian national headdress set with magnificent jewels she also wore wideribboned order st andrew which was her sole privilege wear at most formal state dinners she wore most splendid all crown jewels young grand duchesses were simply but beautifully gowned on all occasions they wore order catherine great red ribbons with blazing diamond stars crowds were enormous all great state rooms imperial family standing for hours while multitudes filed past with sweeping curtsies low bows so long fatiguing were these ceremonies that at end empress was literally too fatigued force a smile poor little alexei also after being carried through rooms obliged acknowledge a thousand greetings was taken back his room a condition utter exhaustion there were state performances at theater opera glinka s life for tsar being sung usual tumult applause adulation but for all that i felt that there was brilliant audience little real enthusiasm little real loyalty i saw a cloud over whole celebration petrograd this impression i am almost sure was shared by empress she told me that she could never feel happy petrograd everything winter palace reminded her earlier years when she her husband used go happily theater together returning would have supper their dressing gowns before fire talking over events day evening i was so happy then she said plaintively so well strong now i am a wreck much as both she emperor desired shorten their stay petrograd they were obliged remain several weeks after close official celebration because tatiana who unwisely had drunk infected water capital fell ill typhoid could not for some time be moved with her lovely brown hair cut short we finally went back tsarskoe selo where she made good progress back health spring began celebration jubilee throughout empire visit volga especially kostrama home first romanoff monarch michail feodorovnitch was a magnificent success people actually wading waist deep river order get nearer imperial boat it was same through all surrounding governments crowds cheers acclamations prayers great choruses singing national hymn very evidence love loyalty i particularly remember when cortge reached town pereyaslovl vladimir government because it was from there that my father s family originated some his relatives took part day s celebration empress my regret was not present being confined her bed on imperial train ill fatigued yet under obligation be ready for special ceremonies moscow it would need a more eloquent pen than mine adequately describe those days moscow holy city russia weather was perfect under clear sunshine floating flags banners flowertrimmed buildings numberless decorations made up a spectacle unforgettable beauty leaving his car at some distance from kremlin emperor entered great gate on foot preceded by chanting priests with waving censers holy images behind emperor his suite came empress alexei an open car through crowds that pressed hard against police lines while overhead all bells moscow pealed welcome sovereigns every day it was same demonstrations love fealty it seemed that no time circumstance could ever alter chapter viii nineteenfourteen that year fate for all world but more than all for my poor country began its course russia as elsewhere apparent peace tranquillity with us as with other civilized people tragedy sarajevo came as a thrill horror surmise i do not know exactly what we expected follow that desperate act committed a distant province austria but certainly not cataclysm a world war ruin three proudest empires earth very shortly after assassination austrian heir his wife emperor had gone kronstadt headquarters baltic fleet meet french british squadrons then on cruise russian waters from kronstadt he proceeded krasnoe near petrograd great summer central review center old russian army where usual military maneuvers were progress returning peterhof emperor ordered a hasty departure finland because he said political horizon was darkening he needed a few days rest distraction we sailed on july russian calendar had a quiet cruise last one we were ever destined enjoy not that we intended it be our last for returning peterhof from whence emperor hurried again reviews we left nearly all our luggage on yacht empress however one her fits melancholy told me that she felt that we would never again be together on standert political skies were indeed darkening serbian murders unaccountably arrogant attitude austria grew importance every succeeding day for many hours every day emperor was closeted his study with grand duke nicholas foreign minister sazonoff other ministers all whom urged on emperor imperative duty standing by serbia during short intervals day when we saw emperor he seemed half dazed by momentous decision he was called upon make a few days before mobilization i went lunch at krasnoe with a friend whose husband was on russian general staff middle luncheon this officer count nosstiz burst into room exclaiming do know what emperor has done can guess what they have made him do he has promoted young men military academy be officers he has sent regiments back their casernes await orders all military attachs are telegraphing their governments ask what it means what can it mean except war from my friend s house i went almost at once back peterhof informed empress what i had heard her amazement was unbounded over over she repeated that she did not understand that she could not imagine under what influence emperor had acted he was still at maneuvers although i remained late with empress i did not see him that night days that followed were full suspense anxiety i spent most my time playing tennisvery badlywith girls but from my occasional contacts with empress i knew that she was arguing pleading against war which apparently emperor felt be inevitable one short talk i had with him on subject he seemed find a certain comfort thought that war always strengthened national feeling his belief russia would emerge from a truly righteous war stronger better than ever at this time a telegram arrived from rasputine siberia which plainly irritated emperor rasputine strongly opposed war predicted that it would result destruction empire but emperor refused believe it resented what was really an almost unprecedented interference affairs state on part rasputine i think i have spoken emperor s aversion telephone up this time none his studies were ever fitted with telephones but now he had wires instruments installed spent a great deal time conversations with ministers members military staff then came day mobilization same kind a day wild excitement waving street crowds weeping women children heartrending scenes parting that all warring countries saw ever will remember after watching hours these dreadful scenes streets peterhof i went my evening duties with empress only find that she had remained absolute ignorance what had been taking place mobilization it was not true she exclaimed certainly armies were moving but only on austrian frontiers she hurried from room i heard her enter emperor s study for half an hour sound their excited voices reached my ears returning empress dropped on her couch as one overcome by desperate tidings war she murmured breathlessly i knew nothing it this is end everything i could say nothing i understood as little as she incomprehensible silence emperor at such an hour as always whatever hurt her hurt me we sat silence until eleven when as usual emperor came tea but he was distraught gloomy tea hour also passed almost complete silence whole world has read telegrams sent nicholas ii by exemperor william those beginning days war their purport seemed be sincere intimate begging his old friend relative stop mobilization offering meet emperor for a conference which yet might keep peace historians future will have decide whether those tenders were made good faith whether they were part sinister diplomacy that wicked war nicholas ii did not believe their good faith for he replied that he had no right stop mobilization russia when german mobilization was already a matter fact that at any hour his frontiers might be crossed by german troops after this interval emperor seemed be better spirits war had come indeed but even war was better than threat uncertainty preceding weeks extreme depression empress however continued unrelieved up last moment she hoped against hope when german formal declaration war was announced she gave way a perfect passion weeping repeating me through her tears this is end everything state visit their majesties petrograd soon after declaration really seemed justify emperor s belief that war would arouse national spirit so long latent russian people never again do i expect behold such a sight as streets petrograd presented on that day say that streets were crowded thronged massed does not half express it i do not believe that one single ablebodied person whole city remained at home during hours spent capital by sovereigns streets were almost literally impassable imperial motor cars moving at snail s pace from quay palace through that frenzied sea people cheering singing national hymn calling down blessings on emperor was something that will live forever memories all who witnessed it imperial cortge was able thanks police reach winter palace at last but many suite were halted by crowds at entrance great square front palace had enter at a side door opening from small garden west inside palace crowd was relatively as great as that on outside apparently every man woman who had right appear at court were massed corridors staircases state apartments slowly their majesties made their way great salle de nicholas largest hall palace there for several hours they stood receiving most extraordinary tokens homage from thousands officials ministers members noblesse both men women te deums were sung cheers acclamations arose as emperor empress moved slowly through crowds men women threw themselves on their knees kissing hands their sovereigns with tears fervent expressions loyalty standing with others suite halle de concert i watched this remarkable scene i listened historic speech emperor which ended with assurance that never would there be an end russian military effort until last german was expelled from beloved soil from salle de nicholas sovereigns passed a balcony overlooking great square there with tsarevitch at their side they faced wildly exulting people who with one accord dropped their knees with mute gestures love obedience then as countless flags waved dipped there arose from lips hearts that vast assembly moving strains our great hymn god save tsar thus a passion renewed love patriotism began russia war that same day family returned peterhof emperor almost immediately leaving for casernes bid farewell regiments leaving for front as for empress she became overnight a changed being every bodily ill weakness forgotten she began at once an extensive plan for a system hospitals sanitary trains for dreadful roll wounded which she knew must begin with first battle her projected chain hospitals sanitary centers reached from petrograd moscow charkoff odessa extreme south russia center her personal activity was fixed a large group evacuation hospitals around tsarskoe selo there after bidding farewell my only brother who immediately left for southern front i joined empress already her plans were so far matured that ten sanitary trains bearing her name children s were active service something like eightyfive hospitals were open preparing open tsarskoe selo peterhof pavlovsk louga sablino neighboring towns empress her two older daughters myself immediately enrolled under a competent woman surgeon dr gedroiz as student nurses spending two hours every afternoon under theoretical instruction entire hours morning ward work hospitals for benefit those who imagine that work a royal nurse is more less nature play i will describe average routine one those mornings which i was privileged assist empress alexandra feodorovna grand duchesses olga tatiana two lastnamed girls nineteen seventeen please remember that we were then only nurses training arriving at hospital shortly after nine morning we went directly receiving wards where men were brought after having firstaid treatment trenches field hospitals they had traveled far were usually disgustingly dirty as well as bloodstained suffering our hands scrubbed antiseptic solutions we began work washing cleaning bandaging maimed bodies mangled faces blinded eyes all indescribable mutilations what is called civilized warfare these we did under orders direction trained nurses who had skill do things our lack experience prevented us from doing as we became accustomed work as both empress tatiana had extraordinary ability as nurses we were given more important work i speak empress tatiana especially because olga within two months was almost too exhausted too unnerved continue my abilities proved be more executive organizing than nursing end hospital work i have seen empress russia operating room a hospital holding ether cones handling sterilized instruments assisting most difficult operations taking from hands busy surgeons amputated legs arms removing bloody even vermininfected dressings enduring all sights smells agonies that most dreadful all places a military hospital midst war she did her work with humility gentle tirelessness one dedicated by god a life ministration tatiana was almost as skillful quite as devoted as her mother complained only that on account her youth she was spared some more trying cases empress was spared nothing nor did she wish be i think i never saw her happier than on day at end our two months intensive training she marched at head procession nurses receive red cross diploma a certificated war nurse from that time on our days were literally devoted toil we rose at seven morning very often it was an hour two after midnight before we sought our beds empress after a morning operating room one hospital snatched a hasty luncheon spent rest day a round inspection other hospitals every morning early i met her little church our lady znamenie where we went for prayers driving afterwards hospitals on days when sanitary trains arrived with their ghastly loads wounded we often worked from nine until three without stopping for food rest empress literally shirked nothing sometimes when an unfortunate soldier was told by surgeons that he must suffer an amputation undergo an operation which might be fatal he turned his bed calling out her name anguished appeal tsaritsa stand near me hold my hand that i may have courage were man an officer a simple peasant boy she always answered appeal with her arm under his head she would speak words comfort encouragement praying with him while preparations for operation were progress her own hands assisting merciful work anesthesia men idolized her watched for her coming reached out bandaged hands touch her as she passed smiling happily as she bent over their pillows even dying smiled as she knelt beside their beds murmuring last words prayer consolation last days november empress left tsarskoe selo for an informal inspection hospitals within radius her especially chosen district dressed gray uniform a nursing sister accompanied by her older daughters myself a small suite she went towns surrounding tsarskoe selo southward as far as pskoff staff headquarters where younger grand duchess marie pavlovna was a hospital nurse from there she proceeded vilna kovno grodno which city she met emperor with him went on dvinsk enthusiasm affection with which empress was met all these places stations along route beggars description a hundred incidents journey crowd my memory each one worth telling had i space include them this narrative i remember for example remarkable scene big fortress kovno where acres hospital beds were assembled where tall figure empress moving through those interminable aisles was greeted like visit an angel i never recall that journey without remembering hospital at grodno where a gallant young officer lay dying his wounds hearing that empress was on her way hospital he rallied unexpectedly declared his nurses that he was determined live until she came sheer will power kept life man s body until empress arrived when at door hospital she was told his dying wish see her she hurried first his bedside kneeling beside it receiving his last smile his last gasping words greeting farewell after one very fatiguing day our train passed a sanitary train union zemstvos moving south empress who should have been resting bed at time ordered her train stopped that she might visit surprise delight doctors this splendidly equipped rolling hospital another surprise visit was estate prince tichkevitch whose family supported on their own lands a very efficient hospital unit it was impossible avoid noticing how towns visited by empress dressed as a simple sister mercy love people was most manifest grodno dvinsk other cities where she appeared with emperor there was plenty enthusiasm but on those occasions etiquette obliged her lay aside her uniform dress as wife emperor much better people loved her when she went among them her nurse s dress their devoted friend sister etiquette forgotten they crowded around her talked her freely claimed her as their own soon after returning from this visit inspection empress accompanied by grand duchesses olga tatiana general racine commander palace guards a maid honor myself set off on a journey moscow where my extreme sorrow dismay i perceived for first time unmistakable evidences a spreading intrigue against imperial family at station moscow empress was met by her sister grand duchess serge latter s intimate friend executive her convent mme gardieve welcome from people there was none as general djounkovsky governor moscow had announced without any authority whatsoever that empress was city incognito did not wish meet anyone consequence this order we drove kremlin through almost empty streets nevertheless empress began at once inspection hospitals accompanied by general racine her maid honor baroness boukshoevden daughter russian ambassador denmark during our stay moscow i was not as constantly with empress as usual our rooms kremlin being far apart however general odoevsky fine old governor kremlin installed a telephone between our rooms on her free evenings empress often summoned me sit with her her dressing room hung with light blue draperies looking out over river ancient roofs moscow i lunched dined with others suite an old part immense palace known as granovita palata here occurred one night a disagreeable scene which general racine presence whole company administered a stinging rebuke general djounkovsky governor moscow for his responsibility for cold welcome accorded her majesty governor turned very pale but made no answer accusation general racine already my mind was a tumult trouble more more conscious atmosphere intrigue plots conspiracies end which i could not see coldness grand duchess serge my childhood such a friend me my family her chilly refusal listen her sister s denial preposterous tales political influence exerted by rasputine by general animosity towards myself i began dimly realize that there was a plot strike at her majesty through rasputine myself there was absolutely nothing i could do i had watch with tearless grief breach between sisters grow wider deeper until their association was robbed most its old intimacy i knew well enough i was convinced that i knew that dismissed maid honor mlle tutcheff was at bottom whole affair her family being among most prominent moscow but i could say nothing do nothing with great relief we saw our train leave moscow for a round visits surrounding territory here again enthusiasm with which people welcomed empress was unbounded town toula for example a little farther on orel people were so tumultuous their greeting they crowded so closely around their adored empress that our party could scarcely make our way church hospital once following empress out a church carrying my hands an ikon which had been presented her i was fairly overthrown by crowding multitude fell halfway down high flight steps before friendly hands could get me my feet i did not mind this being only too rejoiced at evidences love devotion which simple people russia felt for their empress one town where there were no modern carriages she was dragged along an old coach state such as a medieval bishop might have used coach being quite covered with flowers branches town charkoff hundreds students met train bearing aloft portraits her majesty small town belgorod where empress wished stop order visit a very sacred monastery i shall never forget joy with which sleepy ischvostiks hurried through darkness night drive us three four versts from railway monastery nor can i forget arrival at monastery sudden flare lights as monks hastened out meet greet their sovereign empress these were people plain people russia difference between them plotting officials we had left behind moscow was a sad a terrible contrast on december russian calendar birthday emperor we met his train at voronezh where our parties joined visits tambov riasan other towns where people gave their majesties wonderful greetings tambov emperor empress visited had tea with a charming woman advanced age mme alexandra narishkin friend alexander iii many distinguished men her time mme narishkin horrible relate was afterwards murdered by bolsheviki neither her liberal mind nor her long services her country especially her humble friends tambov sparing her from blood lust destroyers russia journey their majesties terminated at moscow where younger children family awaited them i can still see slim erect figure alexei standing at salute on station platform rosy eager faces marie anastasie welcoming their parents after their long separation united family drove kremlin this time not quite so inhospitably received days following moscow hospitals military organizations were visited turn we included these visits out town activities moscow zemstvo county council canteens etc one these centers our host was prince lvoff afterwards active demanding abdication tsar i remember with what deference he received their majesties especial attention he paid tsarevitch whose autograph he begged for visitors book before we left moscow empress paid two visits one old countess apraxin sister former first lady waiting princess galatzine with emperor metropolitan makari a good man but mercilessly persecuted during revolution there was one small but significant incident which happened after our return tsarskoe selo near end year it failed its intended effect but had it not failed it might have had a farreaching influence on world events at that time looking back on it now i sometimes wonder exactly what lay back plot who was responsible for its inception one evening late year i received a visit from two war nurses lately released from a german prison where they had been taken with a portion a captured russian regiment much perturbation spirit these nurses told me a third nurse who had been captured imprisoned with them this woman they had come distrust as she had been accorded many special favors by germans she had been given good food even champagne when nurses were released she alone was conveyed frontier a motor car others going on foot while prison this woman had boasted that she expected be received by emperor whom she proposed present flag captured regiment other nurses declared that their opinion his majesty should be warned woman s dubious character hardly knowing what think such an extraordinary story i thought it my duty lay matter before general voyeikoff chief commander palace guards when i learned from him that emperor had consented receive nurse i begged that woman be investigated before being allowed enter palace emperor showed some vexation but he consented when general voyeikoff examined woman she made a display great frankness handing him a revolver which she said it had been necessary for her carry at front general voyeikoff thinking it strange that weapon had not been taken away from her by germans immediately ordered a search her effects handbag which she would certainly have carried with her palace were found two more loaded revolvers woman was course arrested although i cannot explain why her arrest caused great indignation among certain members aristocracy who previously had received her at their homes whole onus her arrest was placed on me although emperor declared his belief that she was a german spy sent assassinate him that she was a spy i have never doubted but my own mind i have never even tried guess from whence she came chapter ix a very few days after events chronicled last chapter i became victim a railroad accident which brought me threshold death for many months made it impossible for me follow events war growing conspiracy against sovereigns at a little past five o clock afternoon january i took train at tsarskoe for a short visit my parents petrograd with me my carriage was mme shiff a sister a distinguished officer cuirassiers we sat talking usual commonplaces travel when suddenly without a moment s notice there came a tremendous shock a deafening crash i felt myself thrown violently forward my head towards roof carriage both legs held as a vise coils steamheating apparatus overturned carriage lurched broke two like an eggshell i felt bones my left leg snap sharply so intense was pain that i momentarily lost consciousness too soon my senses returned me i found myself firmly wedged wreckage wood iron a great bar steel crushing my face my mouth so choked with blood that i could not utter a sound all i could do my agony was silently pray that god would give me relief a quick death for i could not believe that any human being could endure such pain live after what seemed me an interminable length time i felt pressure on my face removed a kind voice asked who lies here as i managed breathe my name rescuers exclaimed astonishment alarm immediately began endeavor extricate me from my agonizing position by means ropes passed under my arms using great care gentleness they ultimately got me free laid me on grass a moment s flash i recognized one as a cossack emperor s special guard an excellent man named lichatchieff other as a soldier railway battalion then i fainted ripping loose one doors railway carriage men placed me on it carried me a nearby hut already crowded with wounded dying regaining consciousness for a moment i begged whispers that lichatchieff would telephone my parents petrograd their majesties at palace this good fellow did without delay he also brought my corner one surgeons summoned wreck man gave me a rapid examination said briefly do not disturb her she is dying he left attend more hopeful cases but faithful soldiers still knelt beside me straightening my crushed broken legs wiping blood from my lips about two hours another doctor this time surgeon gedroiz under whom empress her daughters myself had taken our nurses training approached corner where i lay i looked with a kind terror into face this woman for i knew her be no friend mine simply giving my wounded head a superficial examination she said carelessly that i was a hopeless case left me without slightest attempt soothe my pain not until ten o clock that night four hours after collision which had wrecked two trains did any help reach me at that hour arrived general racine from palace with orders from their majesties do everything possible my behalf at his imperative commands i was again placed on a stretcher carried a relief train made up cattle cars at moment my poor father mother arrived from petrograd last things i remember were their sobs a teaspoonful brandy mercifully poured down my throat at end journey tsarskoe selo i dimly recognized empress four grand duchesses who had come station meet train their faces were full sympathy grief as they bent over me i found strength whisper them i am dying i believed it because doctors had said so because my pain was so great then came ordeal being lifted into ambulance halfconsciousness that empress was there too holding my head on her knees begging me have courage after that came an interval darkness out which i awoke bed almost free from pain empress who with my parents remained near me asked me if i would like see emperor course i replied that i would when he came i pressed hand he gave me dr gedroiz who was charge ward told everyone coldly take leave me as i could not possibly live until morning is it so hopeless asked emperor she still has some strength her hand later on i do not know exactly when i opened my eyes quite clearly saw standing beside my bed tall gaunt form rasputine he looked at me fixedly said a calm voice she will live but will always be a cripple a prediction which was literally fulfilled for this day i can walk only slowly with aid a stout stick i have been told that rasputine recalled me from unconsciousness but his words i know only what i have recorded next morning i was operated on for six weeks following i suppose i suffered as greatly as one can live my left leg which had sustained a double fracture troubled me less than my back my right leg which had been horribly wrenched lacerated my head wounds were also intensely painful for a time i suffered from inflammation brain my parents empress children came every day see me but despite their presence neglect unkindness dr gedroiz continued suggestion empress that her trusted physician dr federoff be brought into consultation was rudely repulsed by this woman whom i may finally say that she is now high favor with bolsheviki whose ranks she joined autumn waited upon by none but most inexperienced nurses i do not know what might have become me had not my mother brought hospital an old family nurse whom she absolutely insisted should take charge me things went a little better after this but happy was i when at end sixth week against will dr gedroiz i left that wretched hospital was removed my own home there peace security my comfortable bedroom i enjoyed for first time since my accident quiet refreshing sleep it seems strange that hostile envious court circle had deeply resented daily visits emperor empress my bedside placate gossipers emperor before visiting me used make rounds all wards spite it all i had many visitors many daily inquiries from empress dowager others very soon after my arrival home i was examined by skillful surgeons among them drs federoff gagentorn who pronounced my crushed right leg be a very bad condition placed it a plaster cast where it remained for two months empress visited me daily but emperor i seldom saw because as i learned indirectly war was going very badly on russian front emperor was almost constantly with armies last week before lent he came my bedside with empress accordance with an old russian custom before confession beg my forgiveness for possible wrongs done me during year past their pious humility also white careworn face emperor filled me with emotion which later events served only increase for very momentous trying hours were even then crowding destiny nicholas ii tsar all russias a soldier sanitary corps a man named jouk had been assigned duty at my house as soon as i was able leave my bed he took me daily a wheeled chair church palace this was summer a time great tribulation for russian army as every student world war is aware grand duke nicholai nicholaievitch was pursuing a policy which rightly disturbed emperor who constantly complained that commander chief his armies sent men forward without proper ammunition without artillery support with no adequate preparations for safe retreat disaster after disaster confirmed emperor s fears fortress after fortress fell germans kovno fell novogeorgiesk fell finally warsaw itself fell it was a terrible day when emperor white trembling brought this news empress as we sat at tea on her balcony warm autumn air emperor was fairly overcome with grief humiliation as he finished his tale it cannot go on any longer like this he exclaimed bitterly then he went on declare that spite ministerial opposition he was determined take personal command army himself only that day krivosheim minister agriculture had addressed him on impossible condition russian internal affairs nicholai nicholaievitch not content with military supremacy had assumed almost complete authority over all business empire there were fact two governments russia orders being constantly issued from military headquarters without knowledge much less consent emperor very soon after fall warsaw it became clear emperor that if he were retain any dignity whatever he would have depose nicholai nicholaievitch i wish here state without any reservation whatever that this decision was reached by emperor without advice from rasputine myself any other person even empress although she approved her husband s resolution had no part forming it m gilliard has written that emperor was forced his action by bad advisers especially empress rasputine but this he is absolutely mistaken m gilliard writes that emperor was told that grand duke nicholai nicholaievitch was plotting confine his sovereign a monastery i do not believe for a moment that rasputine ever made such a statement but he did my presence warn emperor watch nicholai nicholaievitch his wife who he alleged were at their old practices tabletipping spiritism which he thought be a highly dangerous way conduct a war against germans as for me i repeat that never once did i say do anything influence emperor state affairs i wish i could here reproduce a letter written my father by emperor which all reasons for taking step he did were explained letter alas was taken from me by bolsheviki after my father s death i suppose was destroyed on evening when emperor met his ministers announce his great decision i dined at palace i was deeply impressed with firmness emperor s decision not be overborne by arguments vain fears on part timid statesmen as he arose go council chamber emperor begged us pray for him that his resolution should not falter do not know how hard it has been for me refrain from taking an active part command my beloved army he said at parting overcome speechless i pressed into his hand a tiny ikon which i had always worn around my neck during long council which followed empress i prayed fervently for emperor for our distracted country as time passed empress s anxiety grew so great that throwing a cloak around her shoulders beckoning me follow she went out on balcony one end which gave on council room through lace window curtains we could see emperor sitting very upright surrounded by his ministers one whom was on his feet speaking earnestly our eleven o clock tea was served long before emperor entirely exhausted returned from conference throwing himself an armchair he stretched himself out like a man spent after extreme exertion i could see that his brow hands were wet with perspiration they did not move me he said a low tense voice i listened all their long dull speeches when all had finished i said gentlemen two days from now i leave for stavka as he repeated words his face lightened his shoulders straightened he appeared like a man whose strength was suddenly renewed yet one more struggle was before him empress dowager whom emperor visited immediately after ministerial conference was by this time thoroughly imbued with germanspy mania which empress rasputine not mention myself were involved she believed whole preposterous tissue lies which had been built up with all her might she struggled against emperor s decision assume supreme command army for over two hours a painful scene was enacted empress dowager s gardens he trying show her that utter disaster threatened army empire under existing conditions she repeating over over again wicked slanders german plots which she insisted that he was furthering end emperor left terribly shaken but with his resolution as strong as ever before leaving for staff headquarters emperor his family took communion together at feodorovsky cathedral at their last meal together he showed himself calm collected as he had not been for some time fact not since beginning last disastrous campaign from headquarters emperor wrote full accounts scenes which took place when he assumed personal command furious anger not only deposed nicholai nicholaievitch but all his staff every one whom wrote emperor has ambition himself govern russia i am not attempting write a military history those years i am quite aware fact that most published accounts russian army represent nicholai nicholaievitch as devoted friend allies emperor as pliant tool german influences it is undeniable however that almost as soon as nicholai nicholaievitch had been sent caucasus emperor took command western army a marked improvement general morale became apparent retreat at various points was stopped whole front strengthened a new spirit loyalty empire was manifest i wish interpolate here connection with emperor s personal command army a word on immense service he rendered it at beginning war suppressing manufacture sale vodka curse russian peasantry emperor did this entirely on his own initiative without advice from his ministers grand dukes emperor said at time at least by this i will be remembered he was because condition peasants town workers course army became at once immeasurably better midst wartime privations savingsbanks accounts people increased enormously army there was none hideous debauchery which disgraced russia russojapanese war as an eminent french correspondent long afterwards wrote it is dethroned emperor nicholas that we must accord honor having effected greatest all internal reforms wartime russia suppression alcoholism october emperor came tsarskoe selo for a brief visit on his return he took with him stavka young tsarevitch this is first time he had ever separated boy from his mother empress was never happy except few minutes each day when she was reading child s daily letter at nine o clock at night she went up his bedroom exactly as though he were there she was listening his evening prayers by day empress continued her tireless work hospitals from which by reason my accident i had long been excluded however at this time i received from railroad as compensation for my injuries considerable sum eighty thousand rubles with money i established a hospital for convalescent soldiers which maimed wounded men received training various useful trades this it is needless say became a great source happiness me since i knew as well as soldiers what it meant be crippled helpless from first my hospital training school was a most gratifying success my personal interest it never ceased until revolution after which all my efforts at usefulness service ended imprisonment persecution not this action mine patriotic though it must have appeared no amount devotion empress wounded sufficed check rapidly growing propaganda which sought convict imperial family all its friends being german spies fact that england empress s brotherinlaw prince louis battenberg germanborn but a loyal briton was forced resign his command british navy was used with effect against empress alexandra feodorovna she knew resented keenly this insane delusion she did everything her power overcome it i remember a day when empress received a letter from her brother ernest grand duke hesse which he implored her do something improve barbarous conditions german prisoners russia with streaming tears empress owned herself powerless do anything at all behalf unhappy captives she had organized a committee for relief russian prisoners germany but this had been fiercely attacked especially columns novy vremya an influential organ constitutional democratic party this newspaper general society empress s committee was accused being a mere camouflage gotten up shield her real purpose helping germans against such attacks empress had no defense her secretary count rostovseff indeed tried refute story concerning empress s prisoncamp committee but editors novy vremya insolently refused publish his letter explanation germanspy mania was extended from palace almost every russian who had misfortune possess a name that sounded at all german count fredericks minister sturmer were among those who suffered calumny although neither spoke a single german sentence but greatest sufferers were those barons baltic provinces whose ancestors had bequeathed them names quite certain german origin many these men were arrested sent die suffer worse than death exile sons relatives many these very baltic proprietors were at time fighting loyally russian army that there were german spies at work russia all during war i have no reason doubt but they were men who after invited exalted lenine trotzky not empress her friends nor yet persecuted estate owners baltic provinces did emperor s family call upon germans rescue them from siberia did any baltic provinces at versailles ask be united germany army navy still remained loyal sovereigns on one his home visits tsarskoe selo emperor brought with him as a proof this cross order st george highest all russian military decorations which none could bestow except emperor chief command one armies field this case it was gallant southern army which had voted bestow it on emperor his pride joy it were humbly great chapter x one who has always held honor faith russian people very dear who has never doubted that after last hideous phase revolution anarchism has passed russian nation will emerge stronger better than ever before writing these next chapters is a duty inexpressibly painful i must tell truth otherwise it would have been better for me never have written at all yet picture anything like its true colors decadence petrograd society from onward is a task from which any loyal russian must shrink without a knowledge these conditions however students russian revolution will never be able understand why fabric government slipped so easily from feeble hands provisional government ruthless bloody grasp bolshevists during entire winter when war was being waged on all fronts with such disaster allies when millions men russians frenchmen belgians englishmen were giving up their lives cause freedom aristocracy russian capital was indulging a reckless orgy dancing sports dining yes wining also spite emperor s edict against alcohol spending enormous sums for gowns jewels every way ignoring terrible fact that world was on fire that civilization was battling for its very life palace most frugal rgime had been adopted meals were simple almost parsimony no money was spent except for absolute necessities empress her daughters spent practically every waking hour working praying for soldiers but society when it was not otherwise amusing itself was indulging a new madly exciting game intrigue against throne spread slanders about empress inflame simple minds workmen against state was most popular diversion aristocracy a typical instance this mania was related me by my sister who one morning was surprised by an unexpected visit from her sisterinlaw daughter a very great lady aristocracy bursting into room this woman exclaimed delightedly what do think we are doing now spreading stories through all factories that empress is keeping emperor constantly drunk everybody believes it i mention this story as typical because woman involved afterwards became very prominent grand ducal cabal that forced abdication she was also one two women present yusupoff palace on night rasputine s assassination every possible circumstance no matter how inconsequential was eagerly seized as capital by these plotters a former lady waiting marie vassilchikoff long retired from court living on her austrian estates came petrograd i know not how asked for an audience with empress since russia was at war with austria this audience could not be granted nor did empress even remotely desire it yet as story was circulated marie vassilchikoff was represented as having been sent for by empress negotiate a separate peace with austria that this treachery was frustrated only by vigorous intervention grand duchess serge these stories were spread not only by court society people but were made into a regular propaganda army especially among higher command propaganda was chiefly hands members union zemstvos its most successful agent being infamous goutchkoff who now it is gratifying know has earned contempt every russian political group even including bolshevists thus a whirl heartless gaiety an organized campaign against sovereigns against empire passed winter dark prelude darker years come spring that year my health being still very precarious their majesties sent me charge a sanitary train filled with invalid soldiers officers soft climate crimea with me went a sister mercy sanitarycorps man jouk whom i have spoken on same train journeyed also three members secret police ostensibly protect but really as i well understood spy upon me their presence empress who came pouring rain see train off from station was powerless forbid as she herself was constantly under surveillance dread okhrana our train traveled slowly taking five days from petrograd black sea but this we did not mind as we were very comfortable weather became beautiful our frequent stops at moscow towns farther south were full interest our destination was evpatoria on eastern shore black sea here all us were cordially received m duvan head man city giving me for a residence his own flowerhung villa overlooking sea here i spent two peaceful months finding mud baths wonderfully restoring meeting some unusually interesting people i am sure that few people outside russia have ever heard karaim a racial group among most ancient world whom even then a bare ten thousand existed they were not jews although they worshipped synagogues because they acknowledged christ as god at least a special prophet god they were are if they still exist a strange mixture pious jews early christians leftovers from days decaying roman empire when judaism christianity were trying unite one faith head karaim evpatoria was a fine blackbearded patriarch named gaham with him i formed an almost immediate friendship dressed long black robe his office he used sit with me for hours reading reciting legends his people many reaching back into dim twilight civilization i liked patriarch not only for his simplicity his kindness me but for his evident love loyalty imperial family a loyalty shared by all people karaim a telegram from empress told me that she was then leaving for stavka from which she emperor whole imperial family would proceed crimea for an important military naval review obeying her instructions i motored from evpatoria sevastopol through an enchanting landscape hills plains latter being literally carpeted with scarlet poppies arriving at sevastopol i had some difficulty passing guard but empress s telegram marked imperial i had brought with me this proved open sesame emperor s special train i lunched with empress grand duchesses meeting emperor alexei when they came from reviews at six o clock i spent that night town next day returned evpatoria their majesties promising visit me within a few days on may they arrived received a most enthusiastic welcome not only from townspeople but from tartars who came from hills by thousands from people karaim others as strange as picturesque huge square before cathedral was strewn with fragrant roses over which imperial family walked service next few hours were spent a round visits churches hospitals sanatoriums it was a late luncheon at my villa that they finally arrived after luncheon we walked sat on beach but gathering crowd became so large so curious that poor emperor who had looked forward a sea bath a swim had relinquish both alexei enjoyed day boy fashion without regard crowds playing on beach building a big sand fortress which schoolboys town next day surrounded by a high wall stones protect it from ravages tide we had tea garden empress greatly enjoying oriental sweets sent her by tartars evening i dined on imperial train traveled with it a short distance on its way back petrograd june i returned tsarskoe resumed work my beloved hospital training school weather was unusually hot but empress continued her constant duties hospitals operating rooms often i accompanied her on her rounds it came me as a painful shock that surgeons some wounded officers no longer regarded her as before with respect veneration too often an officer would assume her presence a careless indifferent manner which even a professional nurse would have resented empress never did she must have noticed evidences disrespect but no word complaint ever passed her lips when i ventured suggest her that it might be well go less frequently her hospital she rewarded me with a look reproach whatever other people did whatever their attitude towards war royalty knew its duty would perform it faithfully end both emperor empress during all this rising tide disaffection persisted underestimating its importance emperor especially treated whole movement with contempt which no doubt it merited but which as a national menace it was far too dangerous ignore i realized it keenly but knowing how impossible it was make their majesties understand that everything that was said against me against rasputine against ministers was actually directed against themselves i was obliged keep my lips closed my parents realized as well as i did what was going on they had good reason fact for my mother had received two most insulting letters one from princess galatzine sister mme rodzianko whose husband was president duma another from mme timasheff a woman highest aristocracy letters which indicated a certain collusion between writers them my mother was brutally informed that neither women desired any further acquaintanceship association with her as she too undoubtedly belonged germanspy party my parents at time were living quietly little seaside town terioke near petrograd were studiously avoiding vulgar orgies intrigues society midst all these heartbreaking events i sought distraction enlargement perfecting my occupational hospital which was rapidly becoming overcrowded with invalids i bought an additional piece land arranged for four portable houses be brought from finland two these arrived duly i spent hours absorbing interest watching them being put together on newly acquired land all these days i was constantly being bothered by people who perhaps believing that money i was investing hospitals was another proof my power over imperial treasury tormented me with petitions every kind description but all them alike selfishness their character with cold hatred their eyes but with hypocritical words on their lips these people besought my good offices with their majesties on behalf their sons husbands relatives all whom were alleged be worthy promotions lucrative positions under state one woman good social position invaded my hospital one day treated me a disgraceful scene because i had assured her that i was powerless further her ambition see her husband appointed head a certain government naturally it happened that some petitioners were poor needy these best my ability but without any political influence whatever i did endeavor help i know now after witnessing true sympathy kindness prisoners persecuted like myself later days that i never did half what i might have done time my prosperity if better days come russia my lifetime god help me devote all that remains my years poor especially prisoners now that i have tasted poverty now that i have known hopelessness captivity i know better than i did what can be done for lowly unfortunate a number very disquieting events occurred us during summer on very hot days it was custom empress children drive through woods shaded roads pavlovsk a few versts from tsarskoe selo one stifling afternoon we started out as usual two carriages empress myself leading way horses were magnificent animals apparently very pink condition but suddenly one horses uttered a piercing scream dropped dead his harness other horse plunged sidewise terror for a few minutes it was all coachman could do avoid an overturn empress pale but as always courageous got out carriage helped me who was still on crutches alight carriage children drove up getting we returned without further incident palace whatever caused sudden death that horse what was object that carriage accidentif indeed it was an accidentwe never knew but it left behind my mind i think also mind empress a strangely sinister impression empress nevertheless went steadfastly on with her hospital work arranging convalescent wards concerts entertainments for pleasure wounded best singers most accomplished musicians were secured for these concerts men seemed appreciative them yet over head empress alexandra feodorovna drifted darker darker shadow impending doom things i dared not say her began reach her from others august came from crimea head man karaim whom i have spoken from first he made an agreeable impression on empress children especially upon alexei who never tired listening his stories but gaham had not made journey from crimea relate legends tales he had previously been connected with ministry foreign affairs serving persia east his acute mind was still occupied with foreign affairs empire on which he kept himself well informed determined if possible force empress understand gravity situation he told her a number extraordinary things which had come his knowledge among them an organized plot against throne which was being carried on by near relatives tsar seclusion an allied foreign embassy petrograd his story involving as it did ambassador a friendly power trusted representative an own cousin emperor seemed empress too preposterous be credited horrified she ended conversation a few days later she went taking me with her visit emperor at stavka what he had comment on her report an alleged ambassadorial plot against him i never knew but i soon became aware that representatives other foreign countries were undeniably hostile at stavka were military commissions practically every allied country among them general williams his staff from great britain general janin from france general rikkel from belgium high officers from italy serbia rumania japan other countries all accompanied by subordinate officers one afternoon when gardens were quite crowded by these men men our own army while empress was making her customary circle i chanced overhear a conversation among officers foreign military missions which most slanderous words against her majesty were uttered she has come again it appears said one these men see her husband give him latest orders rasputine suite hate hear her arrival announced said another officer they know it means changes worse things were said but without waiting listen i managed make my way empress that night inviting as i was well aware her irritation disbelief i related something what i had overheard i went further reminded her what we both knew increasing demoralization emperor s staff grand dukes commanding officers were as a matter course invited each day lunch with emperor but with insolence audacity hitherto unheard many emperor s near kinsmen declined these invitations they gave most trivial transparent excuses for their absenceheadaches fatigue previous engagements alleged duties empress listened what i said silent distraught she knew i also knew that nothing she could say emperor would make slightest impression his eyes ears were still closed gathering tempest general alexieff chief staff undoubtedly a valuable officer had i soon learned been drawn into plot emperor suspected him be correspondence with traitor goutchkoff but when questioned general alexieff denied this vehemently he was soon however prove his treachery emperor there was attendance on his majesty at stavka an old officer general ivanoff a st george cross man who formerly had held command army south this devoted loyal old soldier general alexieff knew he must get rid this had he been honest he might have done by pleading age decreased usefulness instead he merely summoned general ivanoff informed him that regret whole staff he was removed chief staff was not responsible for this he declared order having come from empress her accomplices rasputine mme virubova what general alexieff said emperor on subject i do not know but when next two met emperor turned his head aside this sudden coldness on part emperor whom old general ivanoff loved dearly made it impossible for him seek an audience yet general was valiantly determined not leave stavka without presenting his case sovereign calling on me that same day he repeated me while tears rolled down his white beard lying words general alexieff against empress feeling it against reason justice that emperor should remain ignorance this insult his wife i promised speak him about it this i did but little purpose emperor s wrath against alexieff was indeed kindled but he evidently felt that he could not at that critical hour dismiss an officer whose services were so urgently demand afterwards however his manner towards old general ivanoff became conspicuously kind we remained for some time after this at stavka days me such sad remembrance that i can scarcely endure task recording them empress her suite grand duchesses myself lived on board imperial train motor cars coming each day at one o clock take us staff headquarters luncheon headquarters were an ancient villa governor province a rather oldfashioned uncomfortable place even huge dining room where emperor empress staff officers foreign missions met each day was a dull gloomy room when weather became very warm this dismal apartment was abandoned luncheon was served a large tent a shady part grounds overlooking town farther away still flowing tide mighty dnieper only really bright circumstance time was growing health strength tsarevitch he was developing marvelously through summer both bodily vigor gaiety spirits with his tutors m gilliard petroff he romped played as though illness were a thing him unknown with several allied officers notably with belgian general rikkel he was also on best terms every day after luncheon maids came from train with what gowns other apparel we needed for remaining functions day there was little room house which change but we managed appropriate a few nooks corners make ourselves as presentable as possible circumstances emperor s scant hours leisure he loved walk with his family woods along river brink sometimes when i saw empress sitting on grass talking informally with peasant women who crowded around her i took comfort believing then as i still believe that great mass russian people were end faithful their sovereigns as for suite most them became increasingly indifferent bound up their foolish personal affairs diverting themselves with whispered gossip laughter apparently quite indifferent calamitous progress war people whom religion is still these cynical days a real refuge will understand me when i tell them what comfort i found an ancient convent neighborhood poor little church which adjoined it one treasure this church was an old highly revered image our lady mogiloff almost every day that distressful summer i managed spend a few minutes on my knees before her dark mystic image one day feeling my heart imminence a danger i dared not name even myself i took off my diamond earrings laid them at foot shrine where i had sought received peace mind i hope my poor offering was received with grace by saint who course did not need it but whose helpless ones always do a little later monks presented me with a small replica image strangely enough this was one ikon i was permitted take with me when i was sent fortress peter paul that unhappy summer i have only one two more incidents relate one these was a visit stavka princess paley wife grand duke paul coming from kiev where empress dowager grand duke nicholai michailovitch were residence it appeared ominous me that they too all them seemed be inoculated with delusion german spy rasputine influence neither princess nor grand duke were least tactful expression their opinions on subject another visitor stavka was rodzianko who came demand instant dismissal protopopoff minister interior once his friend confidant but now accused by president duma being a lunatic emperor received rodzianko coldly did not even invite him lunch at tea that afternoon emperor said that interview had angered him intensely as he knew quite well that rodzianko s representations motives were wholly insincere almost everything at stavka was growing worse worse grand dukes being more insolent than ever continually annoying general voyeikoff by ordering trains motors for themselves without any regard requirements emperor it was with feelings unspeakable relief that november we left stavka for tsarskoe selo imperial train with us traveled young grand duke dmitri pavlovitch who even then was probably involved a deadly plot against their majesties yet this young man was able keep up a pretense friendship with empress sitting beside her couch entertaining her by hour with amusing gossip stories hearing laughter emperor often opened his study door listen join conversation it was a merry journey home yet within a few days after we arrived troubles again began multiply entering empress s door one day i found her a passion indignation grief as soon as she could speak she told me that emperor had sent her a letter from nicholai michailovitch which empress was specifically charged with most mischievous political machinations unless this is stopped letter concluded murders will certainly begin nicholai michailovitch it appears had gone stavka from group kiev with express object delivering this letter every member staff knew his errand expected him be ignominiously ejected from emperor s study nothing kind happened grand duke stayed luncheon most friendly manner i do not know what he said emperor but i do know that letter was laid on emperor s desk nothing was said done avenge this deadly insult wife nicholas ii whom undoubtedly he loved dearer than his own life only explanation i can think was emperor s complete absorption war his unshaken conviction that plotters gossip was entirely harmless he had kind mind which could concentrate on only one thing at a time at this period his whole heart soul was with fighting armies i well remember scraps conversation with him during those days which indicated that back his mind were many plans for future internal reforms he spoke important social changes which must come after war social constitutional reforms i will do everything necessary afterwards he said more than one these conversations but i cannot act now i cannot do more than one thing at a time empress i think for all her sensitiveness abominable accusations brought against her tried preserve same waiting state mind most disagreeable incidents she kept herself yet one day she showed me a letter written directly her by a princess vassilchikoff a letter so insulting that emperor was aroused order princess her husband a member duma their country estates this letter was written on small scraps paper evidently torn from a cheap writing tablet at least said empress with faint sarcasm she might have used stationery a lady when addressing her sovereign what had taken possession petrograd society i often asked myself was it a mob delusion contagious like certain diseases was it a madness born war similar other strange hysterias which arose during some wars middle ages that delusion was confined petrograd a few other towns frequented by aristocracy was perfectly apparent last days empress with olga tatiana general racine paid a brief visit novgorod inspect military hospitals pray monastery church sofisky sobor one oldest churches russia her visit was opposed quite senselessly by petrograd society which accused her going for some bad purpose god knows what but at novgorod people poured out throngs greet her with peals bells music cheers before leaving city empress paid a visit a very old woman who had spent forty helpless years bed still wearing heavy chains penitence which as a pilgrim she had almost a lifetime before assumed as her majesty entered old woman s cell a feeble voice uttered these words here comes martyred empress alexandra feodorovna what could this aged bedridden recluse have known guessed events which were come chapter xi preceding chapters i have mentioned name rasputine that strange illstarred being about whom almost nothing is known multitude but against whom such horrible accusations have been made that he is universally classed with such monsters iniquity as cain nero judas iscariot even h g wells whose outline history joan arc abraham lincoln are disposed a line sacrifices valuable space state as an established fact that russian court was dominated by a religious impostor rasputin whose cult was one unspeakable foulness a reeking scandal face world i have no desire this book attempt an exoneration rasputine for i am not so ambitious as believe that i can change collective mind world on any point interests historical truth however i believe it be my simple duty record plain tale how why rasputine came be a factor lives nicholas ii alexandra feodorovna his wife exactly what extent he did rather did not dominate russian court those who expect from me secret sensational disclosures will i fear be disappointed for rasputine s every movement for years was known russian police most sensational fact his whole career his assassination has been described by practically every writer events russian revolution i will first explain exact status man for this does not appear be generally understood he has been called a priest more often still a monk but truth is he was not holy orders at all he belonged a curious species roving religious peasant which russia were called stranniki nearest english translation word being pilgrims these wandering peasants common sights old russia were accustomed travel from one end empire other often walking with heavy chains on their bodies make their progress more painful difficult they went from church church shrine shrine monastery monastery praying fasting mortifying flesh their prayers were by a very considerable population eagerly sought devoutly believed once a while a strannik appeared who by virtue his extreme piety gift speech strong personality acquired more than local reputation churchmen high rank estate owners even members nobility invited these men their houses listened with interest their discourses asked for their prayers such a strannik was gregory rasputine who from humblest beginnings a remote siberian village became known all over empire as a man almost superhuman endowment type russians whom stranniki made a genuine appeal emperor empress undoubtedly belonged emperor like several his near ancestors was a born mystic soul alexandra feodorovna either from natural inclination from close association with him whom she so dearly loved leaned also towards mysticism by this i do not mean that emperor empress were at all interested spiritualism tabletipping alleged materializations from world beyond far from it earliest days my acquaintance with empress as far back as she gave me a special warning against these things telling me that if i wished for her friendship never have anything do with socalled spiritism both emperor empress were profoundly interested religious life expressions whole human race they read with sympathy understanding religious literature not only christendom but india persia countries far east i remember connection with empress s first warning against spiritism that she gave me a book an obscure fourteenthcentury missal called les amis des dieu which spite her warm recommendation i found great difficulty reading this interest religion life spirit was actually what constituted what mr wells calls crazy pietism nicholas ii it was simple christianity lived not merely subscribed as a theory they believed that prophecy biblical sense word still existed certain highly gifted spiritually minded persons they believed that it was possible outside church without aid regularly ordained bishops priests hold communion with god with his spirit before i came court there was a frenchman dr philippe whom they reposed greatest confidence believing him be one whom gift prophecy existed i never knew dr philippe hence i can speak him only as a sort a forerunner rasputine because as empress told me his coming was foretold by dr philippe very shortly before his death french mystic told them that they would have another friend authorized speak them from god when rasputine appeared he was accepted as that friend rasputine although very poor humble almost entirely illiterate had acquired a great reputation as a preacher had especially attracted attention bishop theofan a churchman renown petrograd bishop theofan introduced strannik wife grand duke nicholas who immediately conceived a warm admiration for him began speak her friends his marvelous piety spiritual insight at that time emperor was on very friendly terms with grand duke nicholas rather with his wife her sister two princesses montenegro who had married not quite conformity with rules orthodox church brothers grand dukes nicholas peter one these sisters princess melitza grand duchess peter had something a reputation as a mystic it was at her house that emperor empress met first dr philippe later rasputine one my first conversations with empress she told me this told me also how deeply conversation siberian peasant had interested both her husband herself fact rasputine at that period interested impressed almost everyone with whom he came contact when house stolypine was blown up by terrorist bombs among others his beloved daughter was grievously wounded it was rasputine whom famous statesman summoned her bedside for prayer supplication i am aware that public generally believes that it was i who introduced rasputine into russian court but truth compels me declare that he was well known sovereigns most court long before i ever saw him it was about a month before my marriage that empress asked grand duchess peter make me acquainted with rasputine i had heard that grand duchess was very clever well read i was glad opportunity meeting her her palace on english quay petrograd interesting as i found her i was nevertheless thrilled with excitement when a servant announced arrival rasputine before his entrance grand duchess said me do not be astonished if i greet him peasant fashion that is with three kisses on cheek she did so greet him then she presented us each other i saw an elderly peasant thin with a pale face long hair an uncaredfor beard most extraordinary eyes large light brilliant apparently capable seeing into very mind soul person with whom he held converse he wore a long peasant coat black rather shabby from hard wear much travel we talked grand duchess speaking french bade me ask him pray for some special desire mine timidly i begged him pray that god would permit me spend my whole life serving their majesties this he replied your whole life will be thus spent we parted then but shortly afterwards just before my wedding day when my heart was a tumult doubt anxiety i wrote grand duchess peter asked her seek rasputine s counsel my behalf his word me was that i would marry as i had planned but that i should not find happiness my marriage it will be seen how little i regarded him as a prophet at this time since i paid no attention his warning a full year after my marriage i saw rasputine for second time it was on a train going from petrograd tsarskoe selo he being on his way there visit friends who were no way connected with court but asks bewildered reader when how did rasputine acquire dreadful almost unprintable reputation which classes him with archfiend himself answer question satisfactorily i should have reveal at great length strangely abnormal hysterical mentality russian people that epoch i shall try do this as i go farther but here i shall give as a sort illustration lunacy hour a little experience my own it was on first occasion after my arrest by kerensky spring when i was brought before high commission justice provisional government weak ill from my long imprisonment gloomy fortress peter paul i found myself facing an imposing group something like forty judges all learned law clothed such dignity office that i gazed at them a kind awe my distracted mind i asked myself what questions these grave magistrates would ask me what profound language would their questions be clothed my heart almost stopped beating while i waited for words chief judge this is what was said a deep solemn voice tell me who was it at court that rasputine called a flower sheer amazement held me speechless but even had i been given time i could not have answered question because there was no such person judges whispered together for a moment then same man handing me a piece cardboard demanded impressively what is meaning this secret card which was found your house by soldiers i took piece cardboard almost instantly recognized it as a menu card yacht standert dated on reverse side were written names war vessels present at that date at a naval review held near kronstadt russian vessels all among which position imperial yacht was marked by a crown i handed menu card back judge saying merely look at it look at date he looked at it some confusion muttered it is true one more question those giant intellects found ask me is it a fact that empress could not live without which i replied as any sensible person would have done why should a happy wife mother be unable live without a mere friend inquiry was then hastily closed i was ordered back prison be watched more closely than ever because i would not answer judgment this is a perfectly fair sample madness confusion russian mind rather petrograd mind before after revolution that this madness this unreasoning mania for destruction all institutions might have something justify itself public mind it was absolutely necessary find persecute individuals who typified popular imagination things which were so bitterly hated rasputine more than any one other individual empire did typify old unpopular institutions i can readily see why some intelligent fairminded persons thus accepted him dillon for example his book eclipse russia says it is my belief that although his friends were influential rasputine was a symbol russia like eighteenthcentury france passed through a period acute insanity from which it is only now beginning emerge remorse pain this insanity was by no means confined ranks socalled revolutionists it pervaded duma highest ranks society royalty itself all as guilty russia s ruin as most bloodthirsty terrorist what had happened these dark years between is simply punishment god for sins a whole people when his avenging hand has so plainly been laid upon all russian people how dare any us lay calamity entirely at doors bolsheviki we russians look on appalling condition our once great country we behold famishing millions on volga ukraine we count fearful roll murdered imprisoned exiled we cry weakly that tsar was guilty rasputine was guilty this man that woman were guilty but never do we admit that we were all guilty guilty blackest treason our god our emperor our country yet not until we cease accuse others repent our own sins will white dawn god s mercy rise over starved barren desert that was once mighty russia rasputine it seems be generally assumed having been introduced imperial family took up his residence palace romanoffs thereafter held his hands reins government those who do not literally believe this are nevertheless persuaded that rasputine lived very near their majesties saw them constantly was consulted obeyed by ministers with aid connivance adoring women attached court ruled by fear superstition whole governing class empire if i denied that rasputine ever lived at court ever had smallest influence over governmental policies ever ruled through adoring superstitious women i should not hope be believed i will then simply call attention fact that every move rasputine from hour when he began frequent palaces grand dukes especially from day he met emperor empress drawing room grand duchess melitza midnight when he met his death yusupoff palace on moika canal petrograd is a matter most minute police record police know how many days each year rasputine spent petrograd how much his time was lived siberia they know exactly how many times he called at palace at tsarskoe selo how long he stayed who was present they know when under exactly circumstances rasputine came my house who else came house at same time police know more about rasputine than all journalists historians put together their records show that he spent most his time siberia that when he visited petrograd he lived rather humble lodgings an unfashionable street gorochovaia rasputine never lived palace seldom visited it saw emperor less frequently than empress had among women court more enemies than friends englishspeaking reader may doubt completeness accuracy police records knowing that his own country only criminals people underworld are really watched by police know what police surveillance can mean it is necessary have known russia before i do not speak bolshevik police it is fairly well known what they are but after all their methods if not their motives are founded on okhrana old days give an idea everopen searching eye old russian police i will describe what situation was imperial palace itself connection with palace any imperial residences persons emperor his family police force was organized three sections there were palace police a cossack convoi a regiment guards known as svodny polk besides ranking officers these organizations there was over them all a palace commandant latest days empire general voyeikoff it was impossible for anyone approach palace much less be received by one their majesties without fact being known scores these police guards every soldier every guard uniform out kept a notebook which he was obliged write down for inspection by his superiors movements all persons who entered palace even those who passed its walls moreover they were obliged communicate by telephone with their superior officers every event however trivial which they were witness this vigilance was extended even persons emperor his family if empress ordered her carriage for two o clock afternoon lackey receiving order immediately informed nearest police guard fact guard telephoned news palace commandant s office from there information went by telephone offices separate police organizations her majesty s carriage has been ordered for two o clock this meant that from time empress her companion her children drove from palace doors hour when they returned roads were lined with police ready with their notebooks record every single incident drive should empress stop her carriage speak an acquaintance that unhappy individual would afterwards be approached by a guard standing road behind trees shrubbery who would demand what is your name for what reason had conversation with her majesty with all her heart empress detested this system police espionage but it was one russian ironclad traditions which neither she nor emperor could alter abolish if imperial family was thus subject police surveillance reader can easily imagine how closely ordinary citizen especially citizens eminence were watched i would not venture declare on my own unsupported authority that rasputine rarely visited palace at first two three times a year but little oftener at last but i can state that these facts are on record police annals petrograd tsarskoe selo year his death rasputine saw emperor exactly twice there is one unfortunate fact connection with these visits i write it regretfully but it is true i can see how that circumstance served with some people put a false emphasis on visits rasputine imperial household spite wellknown fact that every visit rasputine was necessarily a public appearance full limelight as it were emperor empress attempted throw over his visits a certain veil secrecy they had done same thing with dr philippe i suppose from same motives every human being craves a little personal privacy most loving family circle who does not at times want be alone with his thoughts his prayers behind closed doors thus it was with their majesties rasputine represented them hopes aspirations far removed from earthly power glory from earthly pain suffering they knew that he was a simple peasant that many people rank official circles thought it strange some even thought it undignified for their majesties great russia listen counsels so lowly ignorant a man for this reason i know no other emperor empress vainly tried make visits rasputine as inconspicuous as possible he was admitted into a side entrance instead main doorway he went upstairs by a small staircase he was received private apartments never public drawing rooms it was same tsarskoe selo crimea which latter place a day s visit served for a year s gossip throughout entire estate more than once i pointed out empress futility course pursued know that before he reaches palace much less your boudoir he has been written down at least forty times i reminded her empress always agreed she knew that police were everywhere inside outside palace every corridor at every door she knew that there could be no secrets palace emperor knew it as well as she did yet they persisted trying shield rasputine from publicity they knew be inevitable for everyone it was generally evening that he was received not because eternal police vigilance was relaxed at that time but because it was only evening that emperor found leisure for his personal friends hour following dinner it sometimes happened that little alexei came downstairs his blue nightgown talk with his father a few minutes before going bed when on these occasions rasputine was present boy his parents any intimate friend who happened be room would listen fascinated while strannik talked siberia its peasants his wanderings through remote corners russia his sojourn holy lands his speech was simple but strangely eloquent uplifting their majesties talked gladly him whatever happened be on their minds ill health their only son principally he seemed know how comfort give them hope they were always lighter heart after his visits even had i conspired with him gain their friendship effort would have been quite useless unnecessary they liked him so well that when gossip newspaper accusations rasputine s drunkenness debauchery were brought their attention they said only he is hated because we love him that ended matter i will say for empress that although she had fullest confidence rasputine s integrity she thought it worth while make some inquiries into his private life siberia where most his time was spent on two occasions she sent me with others his distant village pokrovskoe visit him i wished then i do now that she had selected someone wiser more critical than myself detective ability i possess not a trace with me it is always what i have seen i have seen company with mme orloff mother general orloff with two other women our maids i made long journey siberia leaving railroad at little town toumean here rasputine met us with a clumsy peasant cart drawn by two farm horses this springless vehicle we drove eighty versts across steppes village where rasputine dwelt with his old wife his three children two aged spinsters who helped housework care fields cattle household was almost biblical its bare simplicity all guests sleeping an upper chamber on straw mattresses laid on rough board floor except for beds rooms were practically without furniture although on walls were ikons before which faint tapers burned we ate our plain meals common room downstairs evening there usually came four peasant men devoted friends rasputine who were called brothers sitting around table they sang prayers psalms with rustic faith fervor almost every day we went down river watch rasputine brothers fishermen all draw their nets often we ate our dinner by river cooking fish over little campfires on shore sharing common our raisins bread nuts perhaps a little pastry season being lent we had no meat no milk nor butter on my return tsarskoe selo i described this pastoral existence empress i had add my observations only that clergy village seemed dislike rasputine while majority villagers merely took him for granted as one they had long been accustomed a later year i was again sent siberia this time with mme julia lili dehn wife a naval officer on yacht standert several others a man servant as my special assistant as i was then very lame from railroad accident which i have described this time we went by boat from toumean tobolsk on river toura view relics metropolitan john tobolsk a sainted man time peter great while tobolsk we were entertained house governor department same house where first days their siberian exile imperial family were lodged it was a large very well furnished house on river but one could see that winter it must have been extremely cold on our way back we stopped for two days at pokrovskoe visiting rasputine finding him exactly as before old wife serving maids still occupied with household tasks with field labor i may add that both these visits i went famous monastery verchotourie on ural river where are kept some deeply venerated relics st simeon forests surrounding monastery are many tiny wooden huts which dwell solitary monks anchorites among these was a celebrated old monk known as father makari this aged pious monk apparently held rasputine higher respect than did village clergy they talked together like equals friends while we listened silently but with deep interest wave popular opposition against rasputine began i should say last two a half years his life long after it began long after his name was reviled execrated press society his lodgings petrograd where he began spend longer longer intervals were constantly crowded with beggars petitioners these were people all stations who believed that whether he were good evil his influence at court was limitless every kind petty official every sort povertystricken aspirant grafting politician course a whole crew revolutionary agents spies secret police haunted place pressing on rasputine papers petitions be presented emperor do rasputine strict justice he was forever telling petitioners that it would be no good at all for him present their papers but he did not seem have strength mind refuse pointblank receive them often pity for those who were sick poor as he thought deserving he would send them one another his rich influential acquaintances with a note saying please dear friend receive him it is very sad reflect that his recommendation was worst possible introduction a poor wretch could bear with him one hardest tasks which empress imposed upon me was taking messages usually about health alexei these crowded lodgings rasputine as often as i appeared people overwhelmed me with demands for money positions advancement pardons what not it was no use assure people that i neither possessed nor desired possess kind influence they believed be mine it was equally useless assure them that their petitions if i took them would not be read by empress but would merely be referred her secretary count rostovseff sometimes i encountered a case great distress which if possible i tried privately relieve one day i met on staircase a very poor young student who asked me if i could help him a warm coat i knew where i could get such a coat i sent it student months afterwards when i was a prisoner fortress i received a note from this young man telling me that he prayed daily for my safety release this almost unique instance gratitude remains my mind among memories much less agreeable my visits lodgings rasputine chapter xii there is a photograph which last days empire was published all over russia was i am informed also published western europe america it represents rasputine sitting like an oracle his lodgings surrounded by ladies aristocracy this photograph is supposed illustrate enormous hold which rasputine possessed on affections women court plain language it is assumed be a representation rasputine sitting midst his harem there has been no account published which as far as i know does not dwell on this phase rasputine story there have been books published which most erotic letters purporting have been written him by empress herself even by innocent young grand duchesses have been included publishers apparently never having inquired into their authenticity knowing that my evidence will be considered little worth i still have temerity state without any qualification whatsoever that these stories are without slightest foundation rasputine had no harem at court fact i cannot remotely imagine a woman education refinement being attracted him a personal way i never knew one being so attracted although accusations secret debauchery with women lower classes were made against him by agents okhrana special inquiry instituted by commission provisional government failed produce any evidence support charges police were never able bring forward a single woman any class whom they could accuse with rasputine photograph however is authentic i figure it myself therefore i am a position explain it it shows a group women men who after attending early mass sometimes gathered around rasputine for religious discourse for advice on all manner things probably on part some for gratification idle curiosity i do not know whether not western countries religion produces neurotic shallowminded a kind emotional excitement which they mistake for faith but russia there was a time when this was so for most part however it was really serious people men women who went after mass listen discourses rasputine he was as i have said an unlettered man but he knew scriptures his interpretations were so keen so original that highly educated people even learned churchmen liked listen them matters faith doctrine he could never be confused confounded moreover his sympathy his charity were so wide tender that he attracted women narrow lives whose small troubles might have been dismissed as trivial by ordinary confessors for example many lovelorn women men too used go those morning meetings beg his prayers on their heart s behalf he knew that unsatisfied love is a very real trouble he was always gentle patient with such people that is if their souls were innocent for irregular love affairs he had no patience whatever this connection i remember an incident which illustrates this point also his remarkable powers divination if prefer his keen intuition a young married woman harmless enough her intentions but rather frivolous nevertheless came one morning rasputine s lodgings en route a rendezvous with a handsome young officer who at moment strongly attracted her it was her idea ask rasputine s prayers behalf her special desire but before she could say a word him he gave her a keen glance said i am going relate a story once when i was traveling siberia i entered a small railroad station beheld at a table a monk who recognized me begged me join him a glass tea as i approached table i saw him hastily conceal a bottle under folds his soutaine he said are called a saint will not help me understand some troubled problems my life i replied ah call me a saint but why do at time asking me help your troubled soul try hide that bottle under your robe young woman turned deathly pale without a word rose hastily left room this is only one many similar incidents once at kiev a government functionary approached rasputine asked his prayers for one lying very ill rasputine s amazing eyes gazed into eyes other he said calmly i advise beseech not my prayers but those ste xenia functionary completely taken aback exclaimed how illustration three children rasputine before their house siberia illustration guest room only large room rasputine s house siberia could know that her name was xenia i could relate many other such instances which can course be attributed intuition thought transference anything like but true predictions future events made by rasputine what explanation can be given what his mysterious powers over sick behalf suffering little tsarevitch emperor empress constantly asked prayers rasputine incident which i shall now relate will appeal any mother father a suffering child will render less childlike faith afflicted parents heir throne one day during war emperor left tsarskoe selo for general headquarters taking with him as usual tsarevitch child seemed be good condition but a few hours after leaving palace he was taken with a nosebleed this is ordinarily a harmless enough manifestation but one suffering from alexei s incurable malady it was a very serious thing doctors tried every known remedy but hemorrhage became steadily worse until death by exhaustion loss blood was threatened i was with empress when telegram came announcing return emperor boy tsarskoe selo i can never forget anguish mind with which poor mother awaited arrival her sick perhaps her dying child nor can i ever forget waxen gravelike pallor little pointed face as boy with infinite care was borne into palace laid on his little white bed above bloodsoaked bandages his large blue eyes gazed at us with pathos unspeakable it seemed all around bed that last hour unhappy child was at hand physicians kept up their ministrations exhausting every means known science stop incessant bleeding despair empress sent for rasputine he came into room made sign cross over bed looking intently at almost moribund child said quietly kneeling parents don t be alarmed nothing will happen then he walked out room out palace that was all child fell asleep next day was so well that emperor left for his interrupted visit stavka dr derevanko professor fedoroff told me afterwards that they did not even attempt explain cure it was simply a fact for this for other like services rasputine never received any money from emperor empress indeed he was never given any money by their majesties except an occasional onehundredruble note pay cab fares traveling expenses when he was sent for last two years his life rent his modest lodgings petrograd was paid what money he had was received from petitioners who hoped through him benefit high quarters rasputine took this money but he gave most it poor so that when he died his family was left practically penniless that rasputine whatever his faults was no mercenary is simple truth as far back as kokovseff minister finance who disliked distrusted rasputine offered him rubles if he would leave petrograd never return two hundred thousand rubles was a fortune beyond dream avarice a russian peasant but rasputine declined it saying that he was not be bought by anybody if their majesties wish me leave petrograd he said i will go at once for no money at all i know many cases illness where prayers rasputine were asked had he been so minded he might have demanded been given vast sums money but fact is he often showed himself extremely reluctant exert whatever strange power he possessed some instances where sick children were involved he would even object saying if god takes him now it is perhaps save him from future sins this indifference money on part rasputine was all more conspicuous a country where almost every hand was stretched out for reward graft blackmail episode one rasputine s bitterest enemies mad monk illiador is illuminating illiador was a person altogether disreputable an unfrocked monk my opinion a man mentally as well as morally irresponsible he made friends with certain ministers among them chvostoff one several who after death stolypine held for a time portfolio minister interior between chvostoff illiador was concocted a plot assassinate rasputine this was not successful because illiador made mistake sending his wife petrograd with incriminating documents but he was able send a woman siberia she dealt rasputine a knife wound from which he with difficulty recovered this was after rasputine object illiador s greatest hatred was empress his plot against rasputine failing he wrote against empress one most scurrilous obscene books imaginable but before attempting publish it he sent her word that he would sell her manuscript for sixty thousand rubles publishers america he wrote would pay him a much higher price for book but he was willing sacrifice something save a woman s reputation this low blackmailer indignant empress returned no answer at all illiador lives russia now a great favorite with bolsheviki because his bitter attacks on clergy but whether not they permitted him retain his profits on book against empress i do not know but what rasputine s political influence his treason with germans excuse for his murder was that he was leading emperor empress into german net persuading them betray allies by making a separate peace if i knew suspected this be true i would not hesitate record it here i would not dare suppress such important historical evidence if i had it because all that i am writing this book is for future not present for history not for ephemeral journalism day ministers politicians churchmen haunted lodgings rasputine if any man ever had an opportunity mingle secret diplomacy he was that man as a matter plain justice him i do not believe such matters ever interested him on two occasions which i have knowledge he did give emperor political advice very shrewd advice although it was received with irritation resentment by his majesty one these occasions was when grand duke nicholas whose wife it will be remembered was a montenegran tried his every power persuasion bring russia into balkan wars rasputine implored emperor not listen this counsel only enemies russia he declared wanted involve their country that struggle inevitable outcome which would be disaster empire house romanoff rasputine always dreaded war predicting that it would surely bring ruin russia monarchy at beginning world war he was lying wounded by illiador s assassin siberia but he sent a long telegram emperor begging him preserve peace emperor believing intervention serbia a point honor tore up telegram for a time appeared rather cold towards rasputine but as war progressed they became friends again for after it became inevitable rasputine wanted war fought through a victorious end last time emperor saw him about a month before his assassination he gave a signal proof this meeting took place my house i heard every word conversation emperor was depressed pessimistic owing heavy storms lack transportation facilities there had been difficulty getting foodstuffs into petrograd even some army battalions were lacking certain necessities nature itself said emperor seemed be working against russia s success war which rasputine replied strongly advising emperor never on any account be tempted give up struggle country that held out longest against adverse circumstances he said would certainly win war as rasputine was leaving house emperor asked him as usual for his blessing but rasputine replied this time it is for bless me not i finally at parting he humbly begged emperor do everything he could behalf wounded war orphans reminding him that all russia was giving its nearest dearest for his sake did rasputine on this day have a premonition fate that was so soon overtake him i cannot answer that question it is impossible for me know with any certainty whether not this strange man was actually gifted with spirit prophecy whether his frequent forecastings truth were simply fruits a mind more than normally keen observant all i can do all i have attempted do is picture rasputine as i knew him i never once saw him otherwise than i have described i knew that he was reputed drink indulge other reprehensible practices i heard i suppose every wild tale that was told him but no one ever presented imperial family myself any evidence any facts support these accusations it is a matter record this historians future will stress that this man was called a criminal but that he was never meted out common justice which is supposed be right most abandoned criminal he was accused nameless crimes he was executed for those crimes but he was denied even rough justice a trial by his selfappointed judges did tsarist russia ever do such a thing a man caught redhanded murder an emperor i have added as an appendix this book a document which has been published russian french but which i believe appears here for first time english it is statement vladimir michailovitch roudneff a judge a superior court ekaterinoslav one a number distinguished jurists appointed by kerensky when minister justice provisional government a special high commission inquiry investigation into acts sovereigns other prominent personages before revolution judge roudneff with great courage honesty made an effort sift evidence against rasputine separate truth from mere rumor that he was unable treat matter a mood perfect judicial calm although he earnestly wished do so is proof enough madness russian mind that time turmoil bewilderment anyone at all familiar with rules evidence will perceive how with best intentions judge roudneff often offers opinion where facts alone are called for a great many his statements if given a court justice would any civilized country be challenged probably ruled out however statement is valuable because it is unique attempt a justiceloving individual escape from mob mind russia present impartially known facts about rasputine for his honesty insisting that facts be made public judge roudneff was ignominiously removed from commission by its president judge mouravieff as far as i know believe none other members commission attempted publish their findings i shall always feel that it was a great pity that rasputine was not arrested tried presence his accusers all available witnesses if found guilty punished very limit law as it was he was merely lynched question his guilt innocence will ever remain unsolved latest accounts certainly absolve empress russia from being his tool his guilty partner death whether by assassination at hand public justice has same end righteous judgment god from that perfect justice not worst enemy man could bar soul rasputine one thing more i deeply regret that is that judge roudneff could not have tried rasputine person as he did try me i appeared before him no less than fifteen times i always found him studious at getting at truth separating facts from hysterical gossip all interests justice historical records his reports concerning me there are some errors but not serious ones some confusion dates but nothing important once twice some trifling injustice for which i bear not slightest malice judge roudneff for example accuses me loquacity my testimony jumping irrelevantly from one thought another i cannot help wondering if even a learned judge after weeks imprisonment accompanied by inhuman insults bodily injuries for first time given an opportunity for explanation selfdefense would have spoken quite a calm normal manner however i do not complain anything judge roudneff says me i am grateful only russian a position authority who has had chivalry give me benefit a reasonable doubt all others including members romanoff family who have known me from my earliest childhood who youth danced chatted with me at court balls who knew my mother my father with his long honorable record have assailed me without a shred mercy they have represented me as a common upstart an outsider society who managed through unworthy schemes worm her way into confidence empress they have represented me as an abandoned woman a criminal a wouldbe poisoner tsarevitch they have been so loud their denunciations one defenseless woman that they have succeeded concealing fact their own participation events for which sovereigns were brought ruin they have thrown a blind before their responsibility for bringing rasputine court russia never do they allow it be remembered that it was grand dukes nicholas peter their montenegran wives stana melitza who introduced emperor empress poor peasant pilgrim who had he never been taken up by these aristocrats might have lived out an obscure perhaps valuable existence far siberia it was easier for these powerful ones these sheltered women these noble gentlemen avoid explanation their part russian tragedy take refuge behind skirts a woman who after overthrow imperial family had not a friend on earth defend protect her chapter xiii two days after return empress from her visit novgorod earliest hours december december western calendar was struck first blow bloodless russian revolution assassination rasputine on afternoon december december i was sent by empress on an errand entirely nonpolitical rasputine s lodgings i went as always reluctantly because i knew evil construction which would be placed on my errand by any conspirators who happened see me yet as duty bound i went i stayed shortest possible time but that brief interval i heard rasputine say that he expected pay a late evening visit yusupoff palace meet grand duchess irene wife prince felix yusupoff although i knew that felix had often visited rasputine it struck me as odd that he should go their house for first time at such an unseemly hour but my question rasputine replied that felix did not wish his parents know his visit as i was leaving place rasputine said a strange thing me what more do want he asked a low voice already have received all all that his prayers could give me did he mean that that evening empress s boudoir i mentioned this proposed midnight visit empress said some surprise but there must be some mistake irene is crimea neither older yusupoffs are town once again she repeated thoughtfully there is surely a mistake then we began talk other things next morning soon after breakfast i was called on telephone by one daughters rasputine both whom were being educated petrograd some anxiety young girl told me that her father had gone out night before yusupoff motor car had not returned i was startled course even a little frightened but i did not then guess real significance her news when i reached palace i gave message empress who listened with a grave face but with little comment a few minutes later there came a telephone call from protopopoff petrograd police he said had reported him that some time after last midnight a patrolman standing near entrance yusupoff palace had been startled by report a pistol ringing doorbell he was met by a duma member named puritchkevitch who appeared be an advanced stage intoxication answer policeman s inquiry as whether there was trouble house drunken puritchkevitch said a jocular tone that it was nothing nothing at all only they had just killed rasputine policeman probably a none too intelligent specimen took it as a casual joke one highborn they were always joking about rasputine man moved on but somewhat later he decided that he ought report matter headquarters which he did but even then his superiors appear have been too incredulous act at once protopopoff s message however so disquieted empress that she asked me summon another her trusted friends mme dehn whose name i have mentioned before mme dehn came we talked over mystery together but still without conviction that puritchkevitch s reckless statement contained any real truth later day however came a telephone message from grand duke dmitri pavlovitch asking be allowed take tea with empress that afternoon at five message was conveyed empress who pale reflective answered formally that she did not care just then receive his highness dmitri took reply bad grace insisting that he must see empress as he had something special tell her again empress refused this time even more curtly almost immediately afterwards almost as if two men were same room there came a telephone message from felix yusupoff asking if i would see him at tea later day if i so preferred i answered that empress did not wish me receive any visitors that day whereupon felix demanded an audience with empress that he might give her a true account what had occurred her majesty s reply was if felix has anything say let him write me several times before day ended telephone messages came from felix me but none these would empress allow me answer felix finally wrote a letter empress i cannot quote this letter verbatim but i remember exactly its contents by honor his house prince felix yusupoff swore his sovereign empress that rumor rasputine s visit his home was without any foundation whatever he had indeed seen rasputine interests irene s health but he had never decoyed man his palace as charged there had been a party there on night question just a few friends including dmitri celebrate opening felix s new apartments all he confessed became drunk some foolish reckless things were said done by chance on leaving house one guests had shot a dog courtyard that was absolutely all this letter was not answered but was turned over minister justice thoroughly aroused empress now ordered protopopoff make an investigation whole affair she called into council also minister war belaieff a good man afterwards murdered by bolsheviki police at their commands went deserted yusupoff palace first searching for finding body dog which felix said they had shot but bullet hole dog s head had let out little blood when men entered palace they found it a veritable shambles blood disorder evidences a terrific struggle were found downstairs study prince felix on stairs leading an upper room room itself then indeed whole power police was invoked somebody was found testify that dead night a motor car without any lights was seen leaving yusupoff palace disappearing direction neva winter nights russia are very dark as everyone knows car was soon swallowed up shadows river was next searched by a hole ice not far from krestovsky island police found a man s golosh by protopopoff s orders divers immediately searched hole ice from it was soon dragged frozen body rasputine arms legs were tightly bound with cords but unfortunate man had managed work loose his right hand which was frozen a last attempt make sign cross body was taken chesma hospital where an autopsy was performed although there were bullet holes back innumerable cuts wounds all over body lungs were full water proving that they had thrown him alive into icy river that death had occurred by drowning as soon as news became public all petrograd burst into a wild orgy rejoicing beast was slain evil genius had disappeared never return there was no limit wild hysteria hour midst these demonstrations came a telephone message from protopopoff asking empress s advice as an immediate burial place for murdered man ultimately body would be sent his siberian village but present circumstances minister interior thought a postponement this advisable empress agreed she replied that a temporary interment might be arranged at tsarskoe selo on december january coffin accompanied by a kindhearted sister mercy arrived at tsarskoe that same day emperor came home from front presence imperial family myself briefest services were held on dead man s breast had been laid an ikon from novgorod signed on reverse by empress her daughters as a last token respect coffin was not even buried consecrated ground but a corner palace park as it was being lowered a few prayers were said by father alexander priest imperial chapel this is a true account burial rasputine about which so many fantastic tales have been embroidered horror shock caused by this lynching for it can be called by no other name completely shattered nerves family emperor was affected less by deed itself than by fact that it was work members his own family before all russia he exclaimed i am filled with shame that hands my kinsmen are stained with blood a simple peasant before this he had often shown disgust at excesses grand dukes their followers but now he expressed himself as being entirely through with them all but yusupoff others were by no means through with rasputine affair now that they had murdered were applauded for deed by all society it seemed them that they were a position claim full legal immunity grand duke alexander michailovitch emperor s brotherinlaw went dobrovolsky minister justice with a good deal swagger told him that it was will familythat is grand dukesthat whole matter should be quietly dropped next day december january alexander michailovitch drove with his oldest son tsarskoe selo without slightest assumption deference respect entered emperor s study demanding name family that no further investigation manner rasputine s death be made a voice that could easily be heard corridor outside grand duke shouted that should emperor refuse this demand throne itself would fall emperor s answer this insolence was an order banishment their estates nicholai michailovitch felix dmitri at this wrath grand dukes knew no bounds a letter blazing with anger impudence signed by whole family was rushed emperor but his only comment was a single sentence written on margin nobody has a right commit murder following this came a cringing letter from dmitri who like felix tried lie himself out all complicity crime on his sacred honor he declared he had had nothing do with it if emperor would only consent see him he promised establish his innocence but emperor would not consent see dmitri pale stern he moved through rooms sat so darkly plunged thought that none us ventured disturb even speak him into this troubled atmosphere a letter was brought emperor by minister interior who had a right seize suspicious mail matter it was a letter written by princess yusupoff grand duchess xenia sister tsar mother felix yusupoff s wife it was a most indiscreet letter be sent at such a time for it was a clear admission guilt all plotters although as a mother she wrote she felt deeply her son s position she congratulated grand duchess zenia on her husband s conduct affair illustration empress young grand duke dmitri afterwards one rasputine s assassins illustration minister court count fredericks empress her reclining chair grand duchess tatiana taking tea woods finland sandro she said had saved whole situation evidently meaning that his demand for immunity for all concerned would have be granted she was only sorry that principals had not been able bring their enterprise its desired end however there remained only task confining her before affair was finally concluded she feared they might send nicholai nicholaievitch stana their estates how stupid have sent away nicholai michailovitch this was by no means end letters telegrams seized by police brought palace many were written by relatives close friends people highest rank they all revealed a depth callousness treachery undreamed before by unhappy sovereigns when empress read these communications realized that her nearest dearest connections were ranks her enemies her head sank on her breast her eyes grew dark with sorrow her whole countenance seemed wither grow old a few days later grand duchess serge sent her sister several sacred ikons from shrine saratoff empress without even looking at them ordered them sent back convent grand duchess moscow i should add that from day assassination rasputine my mail was full anonymous letters threatening me with death empress perhaps more than any us instinctively aware endless ramifications rasputine affair commanded me terms that admitted no argument leave my house take up residence palace sad as i was leave peace my little home i had no alternative than obey with my maid i moved into two rooms grand ducal wing palace occupied also by maids honor reached by fourth large entrance palace from that day by command their majesties every movement mine was closely guarded soldier jouk was assigned my service without him i never left palace even visit my hospital when february following my only brother was married i was not allowed attend wedding little by little spite fears palace took on a certain air tranquillity evenings we sat mauve boudoir empress as old emperor read aloud at christmas their majesties saw that customary trees gifts were sent hospitals that usual presents were distributed servants children too had their christmas celebration but over us all hung a cloud sorrow disillusionment never had emperor empress russia rulers nearly two hundred million souls seemed so lonely so helpless deserted betrayed by their relatives calumniated by men who eyes outside world seemed represent russian people they had no one left except a few faithful friends emperor s chosen ministers every one whom was under ban popular obloquy most them were accused being appointees rasputine but this at least i am a position deny sturmer minister interior afterwards prime minister was according witte recommended tsar after assassination pleve wellknown fact that sturmer was head nobility government tver that he was possessed enormous estates that he had held several important positions at court ought be sufficient proof that he needed no help from rasputine any other man sturmer was an old man not brilliant perhaps but certainly a man high principles he was arrested by provisional government fortress suffered such frightful hardships that he died within a day after government unable fasten on him slightest guilt released him from prison social revolutionary sokoloff a just man if wrongheaded has declared publicly that had any constitutional assembly been held russia responsibility sturmer s death would have been laid upon milukoff personally as for protopopoff he was appointed by emperor mainly on his record as a confidential agent duma as a personal representative rodzianko president fourth duma after protopopoff s return from an important foreign mission on behalf duma he was presented emperor at g h q a letter empress a few days later he expressed himself as delighted with man appointment was made one those moments impulse characteristic nicholas ii yet it must have been result some reflection as it was emperor s expressed desire at this time name a minister interior who could work harmony with duma protopopoff who aside from his relations with rodzianko had for many years been a delegate from his own zemstvo union zemstvos naturally appealed emperor as an ideal popular candidate no one could have been more astonished than he when almost immediately after his appointment rodzianko almost entire majority party duma joined a clamor for protopopoff s removal only charge i ever heard against him was that his mind had suddenly failed protopopoff who was a man high breeding was nevertheless exceedingly nervous i always thought somewhat weakwilled he was not infirm old man he has generally been represented being about sixtyfour years age with white hair mustache young bright black eyes that he had plenty physical moral courage was proved by his conduct after revolution walking door council chamber duma he announced himself thus i am protopopoff arrest me if like he was arrested by orders rodzianko but was released later only meet death by bullets bolsheviki that protopopoff was on friendly terms with rasputine is true but that rasputine had anything do with his appointment with his retention office after attack by duma is simply absurd maklakoff minister interior before protopopoff was a former governor chernigoff emperor met him course a journey famous fte poltava a jubilee wars peter great acquaintance was made leisure a boat trip emperor another his fits impulsiveness decided that he had found an ideal minister interior their friendship deepened with time emperor found great satisfaction his new minister s reports which he declared reflected his own point view nothing against administration maklakoff was ever even whispered until late when nicholai nicholaievitch as supreme commander russian forces field suddenly demanded his demission grand duke nicholas it must be said continually interfered with affairs interior government with which as military chief he had nothing whatever do but early days war emperor seemed think it part wisdom suffer this irregularity reluctantly he yielded request for maklakoff s demission saying him with genuine regret they demand it at such a time i cannot stand against them place maklakoff was named tcherbatkoff a friend protg nicholai nicholaievitch a man whose former office had been head remount department state doubtless he knew a great deal about horses but interior affairs state he knew so little that even influence grand duke nicholas was powerless retain him office longer than two months tcherbatkoff was followed by khvostoff who previous his appointment was an entire stranger rasputine khvostoff had made a record as governor nizjni novgorod afterwards as a vigorous antigerman orator duma he was also supposed be a devoted friend imperial family soon after his appointment khvostoff began sedulously cultivate friendship rasputine it is a matter police record that this minister interior frequently played on rasputine s unfortunate weakness for drink possibly he thought that by getting poor man intoxicated he could worm from him many court secrets he was supposed possess failing this khvostoff began with help chief police belezky a plot against rasputine which nearly succeeded latter s assassination this being discovered demission khvostoff became imperative soukhomlinoff who when i knew him was an old man seventyfive was a former military governor kiev before his appointment as minister war had been a great favorite emperor that he showed brilliant ability mobilization russian army was admitted by allied governments fact no intrigue against him developed until some time after beginning war his principal enemies were grand duke nicholas general polivanoff notorious goutchkoff my opinion their propaganda against him was instigated solely with object impairing prestige emperor crimes laid at door soukhomlinoff were almost countless he was accused withholding ammunition from armies harboring german spies his house general being completely incapable performing his duties office him english historian wilton says that time alone will prove whether odium russian war scandals rested on soukhomlinoff on grand duke nicholas at all events it was poor old soukhomlinoff who was arrested tried before a tribunal provisional government sentenced life imprisonment his young wife who was arrested with him occupied a cell next mine fortress peter paul without regard charges brought against her i had reason constantly admire courage selfpossession with which she bore hardships prison life so great was her dignity selfcommand that she became universally respected by soldiers i am confident that this alone saved us both from far worse indignities than those which we were called upon bear prison mme soukhomlinoff managed keep herself constantly occupied she wrote read whenever writing materials books were procurable her clever fingers fashioned out scraps miserable prison bread really beautiful sprays flowers for coloring matter she used paint from a moldering blue stripe on walls her cell scraps red paper which tea was wrapped after months imprisonment bravely endured mme soukhomlinoff was brought trial before a court provisional government her examination was most searching character but at its close she left courtroom fully acquitted applause numerous spectators taking advantage an amnesty pronounced some time later mme soukhomlinoff got her aged husband released from prison saw him safely finland it is rather an anticlimax story that after so many trials borne together marriage soukhomlinoffs was dissolved mme soukhomlinoff marrying a young georgian officer with whom she later perished under bolshevist terror one more person whom i can speak with knowledge was although not a minister falsely alleged be an appointee rasputine this was metropolitan pitirim a man impeccable honesty very liberal views regarding church administration emperor met him late on one his visits caucasus pitirim then being exarch georgia not only emperor but his entire suite were enchanted by charming manners piety learning exarch when a little later empress met emperor at veronesh he told her that he had pitirim mind for metropolitan petrograd almost immediately after his appointment propagandists began connect his elevation with rasputine influence but truth is that two men were never at any time on terms more than formal acquaintanceship as for their majesties they liked respected pitirim but he never was an intimate member their household practically all their conversations which i overheard concerned state church georgia which pitirim insisted was lower than other parts empire church georgia pitirim alleged received too little support from state although it deserved as much if not more than others because georgian christianity is oldest all russia according tradition this church was established by holy virgin herself who after a shipwreck off mount athos visited georgia converted its chiefs established first christian temple pitirim was essentially a churchman yet he always advocated a certain separation church state that is he desired establishment a parish system whereby support church should be responsibility people rather than imperial government unworldly last degree he nevertheless came for his full share slander abuse after my arrest by provisional government my mother visited kerensky my behalf was astounded when he brutally told her that one charges against me was that all my diamonds were gifts from pitirim inference being that we were on unduly intimate terms another high personage whom i wish pay tribute just appreciation is count fredericks chief minister court this honorable gentleman had spent almost his entire life service imperial family having first been attached person alexander iii nicholas ii his family he served with ability discretion rare devotion virtue his office he had deal personally with affairs grand dukes their complicated financial transactions their morganatic marriages other confidential affairs everyone except those grand dukes who with reason had earned his contempt loved this charming man whom their majesties usually spoke as our old man count fredericks his turn always called them mes enfants his house was me for many years a second home his daughters elder mme voyeikoff younger one emma being among my dearest friends emma who suffered a painful curvature spine had compensation a rarely beautiful singing voice with which she often charmed emperor empress count fredericks was arrested by provisional government but owing his great age was afterwards released charge has often been brought against nicholas ii that he surrounded himself with inferior men fact case is that beginning his reign he chose as his chief advisers men ability integrity who had been friends his father alexander iii later he chose men who his opinion were best ones available it must be admitted that there were few men firstclass ability among whom he could choose events war revolution prove this for neither these two terrible emergencies produced russia a single man conspicuous merit not one real leader appeared then nor years which have since elapsed truly has a distinguished american writer pointed out that never could bolshevism its insane philosophy have taken such strong roots russia had not soil been previously so well prepared every russian who really loved his country must admit truth this statement too many exiled russians however still cling delusion that some outside influence was cause their country s downfall let them acknowledge truth that it was russians themselves especially russians privileged classes who principally are responsible for catastrophe for years before revolution national spirit was a state decline few men women cherished ideals duty for duty s sake patriotism was practically extinct family life was weakened last days morale whole people was lower than almost any other country civilized world may blood thousands innocents who have perished war revolution wipe out sins old hardhearted decadent russia may millions still living exile under communist oppression learn that only by repentance by toleration others weaknesses can there be any possibility a restoration national life not by any outside help but by our own efforts by loyal russians coming together not as political groups but as compatriots can great russia rise again out her shame desolation become once more a nation among nations earth chapter xiv for two months after assassination rasputine emperor remained at tsarskoe selo but he was by no means idle fact his whole heart mind were occupied not so much with scandal that had reached its tragic climax yusupoff palace but with war which at that moment seemed favor russian arms according our advices food shortage germany turkey had become acute emperor believed that a vigorous spring offensive might bring war a speedy close his billiard room were spread out a large number military maps which no one household not even empress was invited inspect emperor spent hours over these maps his plan a spring campaign when he left billiard room he locked door put key his pocket i had never seen him more completely soldier commander chief a great army all this time from december february russian front was comparatively quiet furious snowstorms preventing advance either our own enemy s forces alas storms interfered also with railroad transport petrograd moscow were beginning feel pinch hunger a fact that gave their majesties constant concern meanwhile grand duke alexander michailovitch persisted his demand for an interview with empress as his letters her failed their object he began write grand duchess olga empress whose courage was great enough enable her ignore any possible danger herself decided see man once for all let him have his say this decision emperor concurred but he stipulated that he should be present case conversation should become unduly disagreeable emperor s aidedecamp for day happened be a spirited young officer lieutenant linevitch who after luncheon on day set for audience lingered palace apparently occupied an amusing puzzle game with tatiana afterwards linevitch told me that so well did he know extent grand ducal cabal especially character alexander michailovitch that he had remained on purpose that his sword had been ready at any moment rescue empress from insult from attempted assassination as we expected grand duke had nothing new say empress but merely reiterated more than usually violent terms demand for protopopoff s dismissal for a constitutional form government answer these demands was as usualeverything necessary after war no fundamentally dangerous changes while germans remained on our soil grand duke purple with anger rushed out empress s sitting room but instead leaving palace as he was expected do he entered library ordered pens paper began write a letter emperor s brother michail alexandrovitch no sooner had he begun his epistle than he perceived standing respectfully room aidedecamp linevitch whom after a more less civil greeting he tried dismiss may go now he said coldly polite but astute linevitch replied with ceremony no your highness i am on service today as long as your highness is here it is not permitted for me leave a fury alexander michailovitch got up left palace men like linevitch many others as faithful as ever their majesties saw threatening tempest more clearly than those within palace walls could possibly see it day after visit alexander michailovitch i received a call from one finest romanoff connections duke alexander luchtenberg painfully agitated duke told me that he wanted me help him induce emperor take a remarkable indeed an unprecedented step at time his accession throne every member family it is well known must make a solemn vow fealty tsar duke luchtenberg now begged me persuade emperor through empress exact from all family a renewal this vow for lives safety imperial family duke believed this be absolutely essential none them are loyal not one he said earnestly if emperor values lives his wife children he must force grand dukes their families declare themselves quite staggered i replied that it was impossible for me make such a proposition their majesties but i added that duke himself as a member family might with entire propriety do so thus matter was decided details conversation between emperor his kinsman i know nothing but i know that conversation took place because later emperor remarked my hearing that sandro luchtenberg kindness his heart had made a great matter out a trifle he added course i could not ask my own family thing he suggested as one more indication gathering storm there came me at my hospital from saratoff an old man so feeble so deaf that he had bring with him a woman relative who through long familiarity was able act as an interpreter his conversations this old man represented an organization known as union russian people a large group devoted empire persons their majesties with intense emotion he told me that his organization had incontestable proofs most treacherous propaganda which was being circulated by union zemstvos towns under personal direction goutchkoff rodzianko he had brought with him documentary proofs his assertions he implored me help him lay his proofs before emperor i communicated his message emperor but as he was that day importantly engaged he suggested that empress might receive him instead this she consented do but after an hour s conversation she sent old man away touched by his devotion but unconvinced gravity situation as he presented it relieve somewhat dullness gloom that had settled on palace we organized those early winter days a series chambermusic recitals performers being rumanian musicians who had been playing very beautifully convalescent wards tsarskoe selo hospitals at request empress i arranged for performances my own apartments palace inviting with their majesties approval duke luchtenberg mme dehn count fredericks his daughters my sister her husband a few other intimate friends concerts were delightful greatly cheering us all including somewhat lonely young grand duchesses much harassed emperor but something music perhaps its wild mournful tzigane numbers moved empress depths her sensitive soul her beautiful eyes became more than ever filled with melancholy her heart seemed heavy with premonitions disaster partly because her increased melancholy partly moved by just anger against propagandist press which our innocent concerts were described as palace orgies emperor for first time was awakened consciousness that safety his family was indeed threatened at least he became aware fact that despite dangerous unrest times tsarskoe selo even petrograd remained practically ungarrisoned capital was guarded by only a few regiments reserves while tsarskoe selo residence imperial family had no regiments at all outside its peacetime quota soldier cossack guards at command emperor several additional regiments which had served for some time at front were ordered tsarskoe for rest recuperation although naturally nothing this was mentioned order augment if necessary inadequate military force at hand first order was given for a strong detachment naval guards but after these men were actually entrained for tsarskoe they were stopped by a counter order from general gourko who illness general alexieff was command at g h q this counter order being at once communicated emperor he exercised his supreme authority regiment once more started for tsarskoe selo but audacity general gourko had not yet reached its limit when military train reached station at tsarskoe it was met by a telegram from general gourko officer command ordering regiment back front bewildered officer for a few moments was at a loss what do but fortunately news his dilemma was telephoned palace regiment under peremptory command emperor left train went into garrison at tsarskoe emperor next commanded that one his favorite regiments varsovie lancers be sent tsarskoe but instead general gourko left headquarters for palace where a long interview between emperor commander took place by arguments which i have no knowledge emperor was persuaded that lancers could not for time being be spared from their frontline position he recalled his order however it was clear that emperor was at last awake appalling menace disaffection which was closing like black cloud banks on every hand war was going badly as every student times must remember brusiloff s brilliant offensive summer autumn had indeed made it plain that russia was by no means out struggle but although this famous drive had netted russians a gain territory even larger than that which was yielded great battle somme it had finally stopped leaving us with much lost territory still unredeemed emperor knew this it tormented his heart soul intriguers knew it resolved use it as a weapon get tsar away from his capital from his family it was on th th february russian calendar that emperor s brother grand duke michail alexandrovitch visited palace told emperor that it was his immediate duty return stavka because grave threats mutiny army very reluctantly emperor consented go mutiny army was a serious enough matter demanded presence commander chief but other things were at same time occurring cause keen anxiety empress had acquainted me with nature these disquieting events but because international character most serious i dislike even now put them writing however i am here repeating only what was then told me i have no firsthand information offer verification their truth their majesties had been informed finally from a source which they believed be absolutely reliable that center intrigue against throne was not any secret garret disaffected workingmen but british embassy where ambassador sir george buchanan was personally aiding grand dukes overthrow nicholas ii replace him by his cousin grand duke cyril vladimirovitch sir george buchanan s main purpose it was said was not so much further ambitions grand dukes as it was weaken russia as a factor future peace conference unable fully believe that an ambassador one allied powers would dare meddle maliciously internal affairs empire tsar had nevertheless decided communicate his information a personal letter his cousin king george england empress deeply indignant advised a demand on king george for ambassador s recall but emperor replied that he dared not at such a critical time make public his distrust an ally s representative whether not emperor ever wrote his letter king george i never knew but that his anxiety depression spirits persisted i can well testify on evening february day before emperor s departure i gave a small dinner some intimate friends among officers naval guard mme dehn helping me my duties as hostess a note from empress summoned us all spend end evening her sitting room as soon as i saw emperor i knew that he was seriously upset during tea hour he spoke little when i tried catch his eye he turned his head aside empress murmured my ear that all his instincts warned him against leaving tsarskoe selo at that time as this coincided exactly with my own judgment i ventured tell him on saying good night that i should hope last moment that he would not go away until worst uncertainties petrograd were removed at this he smiled almost cheerfully said that i must not allow myself be frightened by wild rumors idle gossip go he must but within ten days he expected be able return next morning i went door watched his motor car drive out palace grounds empress children going with it as far as station as usual on such occasions there was a display flags guards standing at salute bells from churches pealing their farewell everything appeared same yet that hour flags soldiers pealing bells were speeding tsar all russias his doom i felt ill that morning ill physically as well as mentally yet as duty bound i went my hospital where a soldier whose case i took a special interest was undergo an operation which he dreaded at which he had implored me be present while anesthetic was being administered i stood beside poor man holding his hand but at same time i realized that i was becoming feverish that my headache was almost unbearably increasing returning palace i lay down my bedroom after writing a line empress excusing myself from tea an hour later tatiana came sympathetic as usual but troubled because both olga alexei were bed with high temperatures doctors suspected that they might be coming down with measles a week two before some small cadets from military school had spent afternoon playing with alexei one these boys had a cough such a flushed face that empress had called attention m gilliard child fearing illness next day we heard that he was ill with measles but because our minds were so troubled with many other things none us thought much danger contagion as for me even after tatiana had told me that olga alexei were suspected cases it did not at once occur me that i was going be ill still my temperature went on rising my headache was unrelieved i lay bed all next day until dinner hour when mme dehn came i made a futile effort get up dress mme dehn made me lie down again looking me over carefully she said look very badly me i think will have have doctor next instant so it seemed me doctor was room i heard him say measles a bad case then i drifted off into sleep unconsciousness that same day tatiana fell ill now empress had four us on her hands putting on her nurse s uniform she spent all succeeding days between her children s rooms mine half conscious i felt gratefully her capable hands arranging my pillows smoothing my burning forehead holding my lips medicines cooling drinks already as i heard vaguely marie anastasie had begun cough but this news disturbed me only as a passing dream i was conscious presence my mother father my younger sister still as a kind nightmare i understood that they empress spoke hurried whispers riots disorders petrograd but first days revolution strikes petrograd moscow revolt mobs hesitancy halfdisciplined reserves restore order i know nothing except what was afterwards related me i do know however that through it all empress russia was completely calm courageous that when my sister hurrying palace after witnessing wild scenes petrograd had cried out empress that end had come her fears were quieted by brave reassuring words it was devoted old grand duke paul as empress afterwards told me who brought her first official tidings made her understand that that most calamitous all blunders a political revolution midst world war had been accomplished even then she lost none her marvelous courage she did not call upon ministers upon allied ambassadors protect her her children with dignity unmoved she witnessed day by day cowardly desertion men who for years had lived at court who had enjoyed faith friendship imperial family one by one they went general racine count apraxine officers men bodyguard servants oldest most trusted all with smooth excuses apologies which translated meant only sauve qui peut one night came noise rioting sharp staccato machine guns apparently approaching nearer nearer palace it was about eleven o clock empress was sitting for a few minutes rest on edge my bed getting up hastily wrapping herself a white shawl she beckoned marie last children on her feet went out palace into icy air face whatever threatened naval guard konvoi cossacks still remained on duty although even then they were preparing desert it is altogether possible that they would have gone over rioters that night had it not been for unexpected appearance empress her daughter from one guard another they passed stately woman courageous young girl undaunted both face deadly danger speaking words encouragement most all simple faith confidence this alone held men at their posts during that dreadful night prevented rioters from attacking palace next day guards disappeared naval guards led by grand duke cyril vladimirovitch marched with red flags duma presented themselves rodzianko as joyful revolutionists very men who previous midnight had hailed empress with traditional greeting zdravie jelaim vashie imperatorskoe velichestvo health long life your majesty so loud had been their greeting that empress not wishing me know that she had left palace sent a servant tell me that guards were waiting meet emperor there was now about palace practically no one defend imperial family case mob decided attack still empress remained calm saying only that she hoped no blood would have be shed their defense a telegram from emperor revealed that crisis had become known him for he implored empress join him with children at headquarters at same hour came an astounding message empress from rodzianko now head provisional government notifying her that she her whole family must vacate palace at once her answer both messages was that she could not leave because all five children were dangerously ill rodzianko s reply this appeal an anguished mother was when house is on fire it is time for everything be thrown out desperately empress consulted doctors nurses could children possibly be moved could anna what was be done case provisional government proved altogether pitiless into this soulracking dilemma mother came wife emperor terrible news his abdication i could not be with her that hour woe nor did i even see her until following morning it was my parents who broke news me almost too ill too cloudy mind comprehend it mme dehn who was with empress on evening when grand duke paul arrived with fatal tidings has described scene when brokenhearted empress left grand duke returned her own room her face was distorted with agony her eyes were full tears she tottered rather than walked i rushed forward supported her until she reached writing table between windows she leaned heavily against it taking my hands hers she said brokenly abdiqu i could hardly believe my ears i waited for her next words they were scarcely audible at last still speaking french for mme dehn spoke no english poor darlingalone there sufferingmy god what he must have suffered that hour supreme agony there was not a word spoken loss a throne alexandra feodorovna s whole heart was with her husband her sole fears that he might be danger that their boy might be taken from them at once she began send frantic telegrams emperor begging him come home as soon as possible with refinement cruelty which marked whole conduct provisional government those days these telegrams were returned empress marked blue pencil address person mentioned unknown not even this insolence nor all her fears broke sublime courage empress when next morning she entered my sickroom saw by my teardrenched face that i knew what had happened her only visible emotion was a slight irritation that other lips than her own had brought me news they should have known that i preferred tell myself she said it was only when gone her rounds palace was alone her own bedroom that she finally gave way her grief mama cried terribly little grand duchess marie told me i cried too but not more than i could help for poor mama s sake never my life i am certain shall i behold such proud fortitude as was shown all through those days wreck disaster by empress her children not one single word bitterness resentment passed their lips know annia said empress gently all is finished for our russia but we must not blame people soldiers for what has happened too well we knew on whose shoulders burden responsibility really rested by this time olga alexei were decidedly better but tatiana anastasie were still very ill marie was first serious stage disease empress her hospital uniform moved tirelessly from one bed another perceiving that from my floor palace practically every servant had fled even my nurses my once devoted jouk having yielded general panic she found people move my bed upstairs old nursery emperor we were now almost alone palace my father s resignation having been demanded course given my parents were detained petrograd days passed still no word came from emperor empress s endurance had almost reached its breaking point when there came palace a young woman wife an obscure officer who threw herself at feet empress begged be allowed dangerous task getting a letter through emperor gratefully indeed did empress accept offer within an hour brave woman was on her way mogiloff how she managed reach headquarters how she passed cordon soldiers finally succeeded delivering captive emperor his wife s letter we never knew but all honor this heroic woman she did it palace was now full revolutionary soldiers quite drunk with their new liberty their heavy boots tramped through all rooms corridors groups dirty unshaven men were constantly pushing their way into nurseries bawling out hoarsely show us alexei for it was heir who most all aroused interest curiosity mob meanwhile behind closed doors anxiously awaiting arrival emperor empress her few faithful friends were at work forestalling coming kerensky by burning destroying letters diaries intimate personal records too precious be allowed fall into ruthless hands enemies chapter xv anxiety almost unbearable we waited until morning march russian arrival emperor i was still confined my bed dr botkine was making me his first visit day when my door flew open mme dehn pale with excitement rushed my bedside exclaiming breathlessly he has come as soon as she could command words she described arrival emperor not as yore attended but guarded like a prisoner by armed soldiers empress was with alexei when motor cars drove into palace grounds mme dehn told how she sprang her feet overjoyed ran like a schoolgirl down stairs through long corridors meet her husband for a time at least happiness reunion blotted out suspense past gloomy uncertainty future but afterwards alone behind their own closed doors emotion betrayed deserted emperor completely overcame his selfcontrol he sobbed like a child on breast his wife it was four o clock afternoon before she could come me when she came i read her white drawn face whole story ordeal through which she had passed with prideful composure she related events day i tried match her courage but i am afraid i failed i who all twelve years my life palace had but three times seen tears eyes emperor was entirely overwhelmed at her recital he will not break down a second time she said with a brave smile he is walking garden now come window see she helped me window herself pulled aside curtain never never while i live shall i forget what we saw we two clinging together shame sorrow for our disgraced country below garden palace which had been his home for twenty years stood man who until a few days before had been tsar all russias with him was his faithful friend prince dolgorouky surrounding them were six soldiers say rather six hooligans armed with rifles with their fists with butts their guns they pushed emperor this way that as though he were some wretched vagrant they were baiting a country road can t go there gospodin polkovnik mr colonel we don t permit walk that direction gospodin polkovnik stand back when are commanded gospodin polkovnik emperor apparently unmoved looked from one these coarse brutes another with great dignity turned walked back towards palace i had been a very sick woman i was now hardly fit stand on my feet light went out suddenly i fainted but empress did not faint she got me back my bed fetched cold water when i awoke it was feel her cool hand bathing my head from her calm detached manner no one could have guessed that scene we had just witnessed was part also her own tragedy before leaving me she said as a child if will promise be very good not cry he shall come see this evening after dinner they came emperor empress with our friend lili dehn two women sat down at a table with their needlework leaving emperor free sit by my bed talk me privately i have tried show nicholas ii as a human person with human emotions i have no desire now represent him hour his humiliation as other than a man feeling keenly acutely bitterness his position i had been unable until day his return realize with any degree clarity full extent his calamity it was me almost unbelievable that his enemies who had so long plotted schemed for his overthrow had at last succeeded it was beyond reason that emperor finest best whole romanoff family should be allowed fall under feet his decadent treacherous kinsmen subjects but emperor his eyes hard glistening told me that it was indeed true he added if all russia came me now on their knees i would never return with tears his voice he spoke men his most trusted relations friends who had turned against him caused his downfall he read me telegrams from brusiloff alexieff other his generals others from members family including a message from nicholai nicholaievitch which writers on their knees begged his imperial majesty for salvation russia abdicate whose favor did they wish him abdicate weak ineffectual duma great untaught masses people no their own blind selfseeking oligarchy which under a regent its own choosing would rule boy alexei through him people uncounted wealth russia but this at least emperor could did prevent both his heart his mind forbade him abdicate favor tsarevitch my boy i will not give them he said feelingly let them get some one else michail if he thinks he is strong enough i regret that i cannot remember every word emperor told me scenes his train when deputation from duma came demand his abdication i was trying too hard obey empress s injunction be good not cry but i remember his telling me how arrogant vain deputies especially goutchkoff shoulgin showed themselves on their departure emperor s first words were addressed two tall cossacks who stood guard at his door it is time now for tear my initials from your shoulder straps he told them cossacks saluted one them said please your imperial majesty please allow us kill them but emperor replied it is too late do that now his mother who hurried from kiev accompanied by grand duke alexander michailovitch see him he said that he was vastly comforted have her near him but that sight grand duke was unendurable driving away from train with empress dowager emperor had been much moved see people along whole distance two versts fall on their knees bid him farewell there was a group schoolgirls from institute at mogiloff who forced their way past guards surrounded their sovereign begging his handkerchief his autograph on bits paper buttons from his uniform anything for a last souvenir emperor s face grew sharply lined when he spoke those brave girls kneeling people why did not appeal them i asked why did not appeal soldiers but emperor answered gently people knew themselves powerless as for appealing soldiers how could i already i had heard threats murdering my family his wife children he said were all on earth he had left live for now their happiness wellbeing were all his soul desired as for empress more than himself real object malice only over his body should any hand be raised injure her giving way once more for a brief moment his grief emperor murmured half himself but there is no justice no justice on earth then as if apology he said it has shaken me badly as see for first few days i was so little myself that i could not even write my diary as we talked it came over me for first time full force that all was indeed finished for russia army was disrupted nation fallen i could foresee some extent at least horrors we should have meet but a kind desperate hope i asked emperor if he did not think that riots strikes would now be put down he shook his head not for two years at least he predicted but what did he think was become him empress children he did not know but there was one prayer he should not be too proud make his enemies that was that they should not send him out russia let me live here my own country as humblest most obscure proprietor tilling land earning poorest living he exclaimed send us any distant corner russia but only let us stay this was only time i ever saw emperor least degree unmanned overcome with bitterness grief which i knew must have filled his spirit after that first day palace gardens he gave his jailers no opportunity insulting him with prince dolgorouky he walked out daily but only along near pathways palace doors snow was heavy on ground two men vigorously exercised themselves shoveling it from paths roadways often emperor would look up from this strenuous work wave a hand those us who were watching from windows solitude my sick chamber i tormented myself with thoughts what might be store for emperor beloved family whose happiness wellbeing were more him than most exalted throne they were all prisoners duma now what dark hapless fate was ruthless irresponsible duma preparing for them not a comforting question haunt mind one ill body soul from my first waking moment on i lived anticipation daily visit empress she who had all at stake still kept her wonderful courage alive she came tall stately a smile on her gentle melancholy face bringing me news nurseries messages from children making me work doing everything possible cheer lighten my mind evening emperor usually came wheeling his wife her invalid s chair for by night her strength had all but gone they stayed with me for an hour then went on say good night suite drawing room sadly diminished numbers was that suite but unchanged fealty affection for fallen majesty among those devoted friends who appeared almost like survivors a shipwreck were count benkendorff brother former russian ambassador great britain his wife who had boldly arrived at palace when it was first surrounded by mutinous soldiers two maids honor baroness buxhoevden countess hendrikoff faithful miss schneider trina mme dehn count fredericks general voyeikoff hussar officer general groten two devoted aidesdecamp lieutenant linevitch count zamirsky who had flown palace be near empress after abdication had been forced leave they too would have remained end household m gilliard mr gibbs french english tutors alexei had elected remain madeleine several other personal attendants including three nurses also stayed good times we served family said these honest souls never will we forsake them now not once after very first our conversations not at any time i believe others palace did emperor empress make smallest complaint their captivity they seemed suffer for russia rather than for themselves for they knew said so that army suddenly midst war released from all discipline would soon cease fight efficiently perhaps obey orders at all this course world knows is precisely what did happen emperor i must admit sometimes betrayed a gruesome kind humor over fantastic blunders selfstyled statesmen who were so rapidly making general shipwreck their revolution every way they showed their weakness bewilderment whether not they feared trust old officers empire with custody imperial family i cannot be sure but men they sent tsarskoe were a constant source ironic mirth suite most these men were young raw underbred inexperienced best them being junior officers promoted since one day one guard officers just show how democratic russia had become swaggered up emperor offered shake hands with him unfortunately as he afterwards told me emperor was so busy shoveling snow that he could not take advantage man s condescension newly appointed commandant palace was a young man named paul kotzebou before war an officer lancers but for some piece misconduct cashiered from service i had long known kotzebou aside from his doubtful army record i was not sorry see him palace for i knew that if weak character he was at least kind heart kind indeed he proved himself for he visited my sickroom friendly fashion risked arrest by consenting smuggle letters my parents petrograd was first warn me that provisional government was contemplating my arrest many old friends advisers emperor were already prison but proposal arrest a woman whose sole crime had been devotion empress her children gave us all an uncomfortable premonitory shock distress empress was greater almost than her pride mercy she would have scorned ask for herself she was ready beg for me she did most earnestly implore kotzebou intercede my behalf what possible good will it do them arrest one helpless woman she urged parting with her would be like losing one my own children kotzebou whatever his feelings could only reply if i could madamebut there is nothing i can do nothing emperor alone refused believe my arrest at all probable but others were badly frightened at prospect sister mercy who had worked my hospital was taking care me almost went on her knees emperor empress now is time show your real love for anna alexandrovna she cried take her into rooms your own children never let anybody touch her cooler counsel came from count benkendorff who advised emperor empress not oppose my arrest if it were ordered only result opposition he pointed out would be more arrests perhaps increased hardship for empress i do not think they will detain her unless it is one rooms tauride he said meaning that i might only be isolated for a time palace where duma held its sessions count benkendorff was later learn what kind justice was being prepared by criminal lunatics who were at russia s throat one morning towards th march i had a hurried note from empress contents which were enough make me forget all my own troubles marie who had been very ill who now she feared was dying was calling constantly for me servant who brought note told me that anastasie also was a critical condition lungs ears being a sad state inflammation oxygen alone was keeping children alive kotzebou was calling on me at time as i sat up bed wildly demanding be dressed he begged me not leave my room they are only waiting until are well enough be arrested he assured me but though i feared arrest i feared still more letting child i loved die with one single wish unfulfilled as soon as i could be sufficiently clothed it was kotzebou himself who wheeled my chair through long corridors nurseries it was first time weeks that i had seen children our meeting was full tears we wept each other s arms then without wasting any time i went on into marie s room child indeed seemed be at point death but when she saw me suffering her eyes turned something like joy her weak hands fluttered on bedclothes with a feeble cry annia annia she began weep long i sat beside her holding her hot wasted body my arms when i left her she was asleep shaken though i was with that experience i had one more agony bear when my chair was being wheeled back along corridor i passed open door alexei s room this is what i saw lying sprawled a chair was sailor derevanko for many years personal attendant tsarevitch on whom family had bestowed every kindness every material benefit bitten by mania revolution this man was now displaying his gratitude for all their favors insolently he bawled at boy whom he had formerly loved cherished bring him this that perform any menial service his mean lackey s brain could think dazed apparently only half conscious what he was being forced do child moved about trying obey it was too much bear hiding my face my hands i begged them take me away from sickening spectacle next day my last palace i went again children for a few hours at least was a little bit happy emperor empress had luncheon served nurseries we were all able eat some comfort because both marie anastasie were showing signs improvement still we were troubled because kotzebou as a reward for his too kindly treatment captives had that morning been removed from palace doctors when they came brought with them newspapers fair samples new free press russia bristling with frightful stories especially about me for first time i began realize with a sick heart what an arrest might mean what grotesque charges i might be called upon face for first time these newspapers i read amazing tale how i had conspired with dr badmieff poison emperor tsarevitch dr badmieff that half mad old siberian root herb doctor who never his life had been admitted palace as a physician even as a friend it was too absurd resent even empress who at first had shown anger burst into mocking laughter here annia she cried keep this story for your collection next day i was arrested i awoke a morning storm howling wind my soul a feeling dread foreboding immediately after my coffee i wrote a note empress asking her not wait until afternoon see me her reply was kind cheering but she was busy nurseries could not leave until after arrival doctors with luncheon came lili dehn scarcely had we finished meal when we were aware great noise confusion corridor outside an icy hand seemed seize my heart they are coming i whispered mme dehn springing from her chair cried impossible nono panicstruck fled room door flew open admit a frightened servant with a note from empress kerensky is going through our rooms do not be frightened god is with us hardly had man retired when again door opened another frightened servant a palace messenger a feathered cap announced a drowned voice arrival kerensky a moment room seemed fill up with men walking arrogantly before them i beheld a small cleanshaven theatrical person whose essentially weak face was disguised a napoleonic frown standing over me his characteristic attitude right hand thrust into bosom his jacket man boomed out i am minister justice are dress go at once petrograd i answered not a word but lay still on my pillows looking him straight face this seemed disconcert him somewhat for he turned one his officers said nervously ask doctors if she is fit go otherwise she must be arrested isolated palace count benkendorff who stood back room near door volunteered see doctor when he returned it was with message that dr botkine gave them permission take me afterwards i learned that empress reproached doctor bitterly saying over over through her tears how can how can who have children your own but dr botkine was by this time a victim craven fear he was incapable refusing any request provisional government they gave me time dress warmly i had a moment which reply briefly a note from emperor empress which they enclosed small pictures christ virgin signed with their majesties initials n a when at last i was ready go it suddenly surged over me that this might be end my long association with these dearly loved friends my sovereigns whose intimate lives i had shared for twelve years ready fall on my knees before him if necessary i made a final appeal colonel korovitchinko new commandant palace begging him let me see them for one moment just long enough say goodbye colonel korovitchinko who afterwards died a cruel death at hands bolsheviki at first refused but moved by my tears he relented a little emperor he said was outside could not be summoned but he would exert his authority far enough send me under guard say goodbye empress under escort two officers i was taken apartment mlle schneider very soon pale empress was wheeled into room by her devoted attendant volkov we had time for only one long embrace hurried exchange two rings then tatiana who came with her mother embraced me weeping as she too begged for a last memory gift i gave her only thing i had give my wedding ring then soldiers tore us apart but i saw that man who gave order did it with tears his eyes last i remember was white hand empress pointing upward her voice there we are always together volkov weeping cried out courageously anna alexandrovna god will surely help they carried me downstairs motor for i could neither walk nor stand even with help my crutches at door stood several soldiers court servants visibly distressed but by this time i felt nothing heard nothing i was turned stone when i was lifted into car i was startled see there another woman like myself swathed wraps veils it was lili dehn whose arrest had not before this day even been threatened dazed as i was it was some comfort hear her whisper that we were travel petrograd together i recovered myself a little enough at least recognize frightened face servant who closed door car killed a few months later this good man had been for a long time a sailor on imperial yacht take care their majesties i managed say him then motor car shot forward i left palace at tsarskoe selo forever both lili i pressed our faces glass a last effort see those beloved we were leaving behind through mist rain we could just discern a group whiteclad figures crowded close nursery windows see us go a moment time picture was blotted out we saw only wet landscape stormbent trees rapidly creeping twilight another few moments we were at station dear familiar station tsarskoe where so many many times i had waited greet say a short farewell emperor empress ready for us was one small imperial trains now special train kerensky our guards hurried us into a carriage train immediately began move at same time our carriage was invaded by kerensky a group soldiers without even a pretense decent politeness new minister justice began shout at us give your family names because we did not speak quickly enough little man became insulted will learn that when i ask a question must answer promptly we gave our names kerensky turning triumphantly soldiers ejaculated well are convinced now apparently some men had expressed doubts as whether they had bagged right criminals sick half fainting i sank back into cushions closed my eyes on their departing figures lili bent over me with her salts bottle soon i was able sit up with some show courage it was first time i had left house since my illness i was still very weak arrived petrograd kerensky paraded us before his officers like barbarian captives some roman emperor but this did not affect us seriously our eyes were busy gazing at changed aspect petrograd soldiers swanking around streets proud their slovenly appearance badge their new freedom mobs people running aimlessly about pausing listen streetcorner orators everywhere on walls buildings masses dirty red flags an oldfashioned coach belong imperial stables had been sent for us still closely guarded we drove ministry justice there we climbed a long very steep staircasehow i did it on my crutches i do not yet understandand were shown into a room on third floor empty even a wooden chair silently we stood waited after a time men came carrying two sofas on one these lili sat down on other i lay prone again we waited no one near us save unkempt soldier who guarded door evening lengthened finally kerensky honored us with another brief visit he did not look at me at all but asked lili if they had built us a fire it was an unnecessary question for he must have felt icy chill room a few minutes later however a servant did build a fire tiled stove another brought a tray with eggs tea left alone with unkempt soldier man suddenly amazed us by breaking into a volley speech which he cursed most eloquently new order things nothing good would come it nothing was his opinion somewhat reassured because we had a guard who was not at heart a revolutionist we lay down but night brought neither us any anodyne sleep rest chapter xvi morning dawned cold gray so exhausted was i with sleeplessness discomfort a hard bed without linen blankets that lili was alarmed when tea arrived she begged soldier who brought it have a doctor sent me but kerensky replied that doctor was engaged with war minister goutchkoff could not be approached at present within a short time i was be removed a hospital as for mme dehn she might expect good news soon as a matter fact mme dehn was released from custody next day feeling confident that she would be let go i gave her what jewels i had brought with me asking her turn them over my mother return lili gave me a few necessaries including a pair stockings for which later i was extremely grateful because prison stockings were so coarse heavy that they hurt my injured leg about three o clock afternoon colonel peretz who afterwards wrote a book on revolution came into room with a group young boys former cadets military academy now commissioned officers new army say goodbye your friend come along i was ordered after a quick embrace i parted with mme dehn my last link with past followed men downstairs where a large motor car was waiting we all got men s rifles considerably reducing carrying capacity seats as we drove off colonel began a long insulting monologue which i tried not listen ah your grichka gregory i heard him saying what a monument both deserve for helping us bring about revolution but all that i wanted learn from him was my destination as if answer unspoken question he said all night we were discussing most appropriate lodgings for we decided on troubetskoy bastion fortress at this point we passed a church after invariable custom i made sign cross colonel peretz flamed into anger at this don t dare cross yourself he cried with emphasis on last word rather pray for souls martyrs revolution then as i made no response he exclaimed why don t answer when i speak i replied coldly that i had nothing whatever say him whereupon he began revile emperor empress coarsest terms ending with words no doubt they are hysterics over what has happened them then i did speak if knew with what dignity they are enduring what has happened would not dare say what have said after which monologue was for a moment two halted turning into liteiny a street which many barracks ministries are located car stopped colonel peretz dispatched one cadet officers on an errand into a government building on his return colonel delayed matters long enough make a bombastic speech on great services revolution performed by cadets again we drove on realizing that we were not proceeding direction fortress peter paul i allowed my feminine curiosity get better my pride i asked whither we were bound duma first was grim answer fortress afterwards arrived at tauride palace we alighted at what is known as ministers pavilion immediately went into building what a sight crowding rooms corridors men women all ages conditions prisoners provisional government looking about i saw many people my own class among them mme soukhomlinoff who for all her manner betrayed might have been a guest rather than a prisoner we exchanged cheerful greetings she introduced two women beside her mme polouboiarenoff mme riman wife a wellknown general mme polouboiarenoff whom i had heard as a brilliant writer on a conservative newspaper murdered for this later by bolsheviki was quite selfpossessed but mme riman s face was wet with constantly flowing tears a young girl student a typical revolutionist who seemed be some kind authority passed us a hurry pausing say mme riman what are crying about are going be set free while these two mme soukhomlinoff myself are going fortress poor mme riman was crying because her husband was already prison but revolutionary student could not be expected sympathize with that it really is easier be calm over one s own than over another s fate as i learned when i found myself with mme soukhomlinoff once more a motor car bound for that mysterious prison on left bank neva directly opposite winter palace fortress peter paul as we left tauride girl student who after all had some natural feelings asked me for my father s telephone number that she might notify my parents where i had been sent no need bother about that broke chivalrous colonel peretz newspapers will have a full report all better i rejoined for then many more will pray for me rolling into vast enclosure fortress we stopped at entrance troubetskoy bastion a group soldiers dirty wolfish demeanor rushed meet us now i am bringing two very desperate political prisoners shouted colonel as men closed around us but a stout cossack much more human than rest assumed authority saying that he was that day acting place governor fortress preceded by this man we traversed a long series narrow winding stone passages so dark that i could see only a few feet ahead suddenly i was halted hinges creaked i was roughly pushed into a pitchdark cell door which was instantly bolted behind me no one who has not been a prisoner can possibly know sickening sensation which possessed me standing there that dark hole afraid take a step forward unable touch with my groping hands either walls furniture my heart leaped pounded my breast i clung desperately my crutches lest i should fall into that unfathomed darkness a few minutes wild terror then as my eyes grew accustomed dark i saw ahead me a narrow iron cot towards which i moved with infinite caution my progress towards bed my feet sank into pools stagnant water which covered floor soon i perceived that walls cell were also dripping with moisture tiny window high farthest wall admitted little air whole place was foul with dampness odor years it reeked with even worse smells as i quickly discovered for close bed was an uncovered toilet connected with archaic plumbing bed was hard lumpy i do not think that thin mattress had ever been cleaned aired however that mattress was not afflict me long within a few minutes my cell door was thrown open several uniformed men entered at their head was a blackbearded ruffian who told me that he was koutzmine representative minister justice was authorized arrange rgime all prisoners at his orders soldiers tore from under me illsmelling mattress hard little pillow leaving me only a rough bed planks under his orders they tore off my rings jerked loose a gold chain from which were suspended several precious relics they hurt me i cried out protest whereupon soldiers spat at me struck me with their fists left noisily clanging iron door behind them wrapping my cloak around me i crouched down on bed shivering from head foot filled with such an agony loathing disgust desolation that i thought i should die not a particle food was brought me that day nothing broke monotony dragging hours save now again when small grating door my cell was pushed aside a gaping soldier looked then came night hardly darker than day but more silent weak with hunger spent with pain i clutched my aching head with my hands asked god if he had forgotten me at that moment extreme misery i was startled at same time strangely comforted by a sudden low but distinct rapping on other side wall instinctively i knew that it was mme soukhomlinoff who was trying speak me only language prisoners have i rapped back almost happily for i felt that with a friend so near i was not entirely deserted i must have slept after that for next thing i remember was a man entering cell with a pot hot water a small piece black bread which he placed on an iron shelf near bed as soon as your money arrives can have tea he announced briefly tea would have been a priceless blessing that cold place but i was so thirsty that i drank every drop hot water was thankful i suppose i ate black bread too bad as it was for i was very hungry how describe days that followed slowpaced monotonous yet each one filled with its special meed suffering on one first days a grim woman came stripped me my underclothes substituting coarse unclean garments marked with number my cell which was no prison dress seemed be provided so i was allowed keep my own but process undressing woman discovered a slender gold bracelet which i had worn day night for many years which was locked on my arm she called koutzmine his guard soldiers they indignant that they had overlooked a single article value began force bracelet over my hand as little circlet was not intended go over my hand their efforts caused me such pain that i screamed spite myself touched perhaps merely annoyed at this koutzmine suggested soldiers that if i would promise not give bracelet anyone i might be allowed keep it but his suggestion met with no sympathy bracelet was finally forced over my bruised hand awful food still more awful solitude were daily afflictions i think they were really worst all twice a day a soldier brought a nauseous dish a kind soup made bones skin fish none too fresh sometimes if soldier happened be an especially vicious mood he spat soup before giving it me more than once i found small pieces glass among bones yet so ravenous was my hunger that i actually swallowed enough vile stuff keep myself alive only by holding my nose with my fingers was i able get a few spoonfuls down my throat what was left i was careful pour into filthy toilet for i had been told that unless i ate what was given me i would be left starve hot water black bread continued be doled out small quantities but there was never any tea no food was allowed be given prisoners even when it was brought fortress by relatives friends neither was any kind occupation given wretched captives we were not even allowed clean our own cells a soldier coming once a week wipe up wet slimy floors when i begged privilege doing this myself soldier replied a prisoner who works is not a prisoner at all it is true that when he has absolutely nothing do he is worse than a prisoner he is a living corpse actual death being too merciful for political prisoners we were taken out one by one for ten minutes every day exercise ground was a small grassy court where a few shrubs trees gave promise green leaves later on no words can describe relief blessed joy that those few moments light air sight blue sky brought my heart it seemed me that i lived only for those moments course walled court was well guarded by armed soldiers never once did their fierce eyes ever leave me still it was a bit god s beautiful world a breath his sweet air i breathed it deep into my soul keeping it there for hope comfort until next day came center court was a small dingy bath house where on fridays saturdays prisoners were treated a sort a bath on those days we were not permitted walk but i for one did not complain this any respite from gravelike existence cells was a blessing it was still very cold when i lay down for night i never removed my clothes i had two woolen handkerchiefs rather head kerchiefs one these i tied over my head other i wrapped around my shoulders for warmth usually i slept until about four o clock when bells a church hard by broke into my slumbers after that i tried doze but very soon came tramp boots on stones corridors crash wood which soldiers brought each day for their stoves i always woke up shivering my first move was towards a corner my cell where stones were dry a little warm from stove outside here i huddled shook until hot water black bread were thrust i had never fully recovered from my illness cold damp brought on first a pleurisy afterwards a racking cough i was so weak that sometimes crossing from bed what i called warm corner i slipped fell lay on wet floor unable rise soldier who thus found me if he were half decent sort would pick me up throw me on plank bed otherwise he would merely kick me for first two weeks i spent troubetskoy bastion only attendants were men soldiers had keys cells complete freedom corridors first lot were men rd rifle regiment petrograd but within a few days some them were shifted their places were taken by a miscellaneous force from one most unruly mutinous reserves riots fights between two bands became an almost daily occurrence nerves prisoners were tortured by yells blows battle my only comfort aside from ten minutes respite exercise ground was walltapping between my cell mme soukhomlinoff s this had developed into a regular code we managed carry on by alternately long short taps quite lucid conversations once our fright governor bastion chkoni caught us at this forbidden game threatened us if it happened again with dark cell a place unknown horrors as we knew for we had listened groans cries former police chief belezky while he suffered there after warning chkoni mme soukhomlinoff i communicated with each other only middle night when snores soldiers corridors guaranteed a degree safety without these cautiously tappedout conversations i really do not know how i should have lived kept sane cough which had been afflicting me grew worse rather than better only relief that was offered me was a primitive kind cupping which did cough no good but covered my chest with black blue bruises finally at request sanitary soldier who had done cupping prison doctor was sent for this man whose name was serebrianikoff was one most dreadful persons i ever came contact with he had a red malicious face his clothes person were revoltingly dirty increase their effect he wore on his bulging waistcoat a huge red bow emblem his revolutionary ardor when he came into my cell he literally tore clothes from my back a pretended examination then turning soldiers doorway he shouted this woman is worst whole lot an absolute idiot from a life vice slapping me on one cheek then on other he began ask me questions which i cannot repeat here my alleged orgies with rasputine with nicholas alice as he called empress even soldiers looked disgusted i shuddered away from him sick with repulsion that night i was so far gone physically mentally that i could not answer mme soukhomlinoff when she tapped on wall all i could do was cough shiver an incoherent half mad fashion pray my god my god hast thou forsaken me next morning soldier who brought my hot water bread thought me dying insisted sending again for unspeakable serebrianikoff although i begged him not send a woman i implore i whispered but there was no woman send prison doctor came instead declaring that i was merely shamming this brute again struck me face left saying i ll punish for this there ll be no exercise for for two weeks after think yourself well enough go out he kept his word for two weeks after i ceased be acutely ill i remained all day my cell weeping for clean air a sight blue sky little trickles pale sunlight were beginning steal through my barred windows cold was less intense i knew that outside world freedom spring had come one little bit good news came at this time women wardresses had been appointed look after special needs women prisoners two attendants from a women s prison were first arrive but they were so shocked at conditions they found fortress that they refused stay they were replaced by others one a saucy young person whose sole energies went into flirtations with soldiers an older woman with melancholy dark eyes best kindest hearts i cannot tell her name because if she is still alive russia she must be employ bolsheviki i will call her simply woman her kindness me i can never repay but at least i shall never forget it especially since i knew that every kind act she did was at her own personal risk woman was on duty only until nine o clock at night was never allowed enter my cell alone yet she often managed cleverly follow slowly when she guard left cell she frequently dropped on floor behind her little pieces sausage chocolate bread nearly white cell we dared not talk but when she took me bath house we exchanged whispered conversations through her i got a little news exciting events time provisional government was tottering star kerensky was rising rapidly imperial family were still at tsarskoe selo prisoners but alive that knowledge gave me a new impulse live i must record one especially kind act my new friend did my behalf easter sunday came sitting on my hard bed i ventured sing softly a verse two a wellremembered easter hymn on good friday preceding we had been allowed leave our cells one by one under guard confess a good old priest whose distress at our sorry plight so moved him that he heard our confessions with great tears his eyes earnestly this old priest had begged kerensky allow him visit prisoners their cells do what he could for their comfort but kerensky curtly refused i was thinking him on this easter morning soldiers had been running through corridors calling one another perhaps jest perhaps as a matter habit russian greeting kristos voskrese christ is risen which response is voistino voskrese he is risen indeed i could see that soldiers had plates sugary cheese which everybody eats at easter which some prisoners received not i because i was considered too wicked too vile nevertheless because trickle sunshine that stole through bars my window because old priest had really given me great comfort i began sing instantly soldiers outside commanded me rudely keep silent it was too much i laid my head down on rags that formed my pillow began cry miserably then my hand strayed under pillow touching something it was a little red easter egg left there by woman make me feel that even that place i was not entirely friendless never did a gift come as such a joyful surprise i hugged it my heart kissed it thanked god i was not forsaken indeed worst was already passed for me for next day i was told that on every friday after i was receive a visit from my parents whom i had feared i was never see again on earth chapter xvii visitors prison who but one who has spent days nights anguished loneliness behind bolted doors can possibly imagine joy such anticipation i looked forward almost as toward freedom itself first friday when i should see my beloved parents i pictured myself running forward embrace them i could see my father s kind loving smile my mother s blue eyes full happy tears how we would sit hand hand talk over all that had happened since our parting they would bring me news messages perhaps even letters from those other captives tsarskoe selo i should hear that children were well again empress s deepest anxieties were removed alas harsh reality my foolish dreams when day came i limped between armed soldiers through long gray corridors visitors room there at end a long wooden table which divided us like an impassable gulf i saw my mother there was no embrace allowed not even a touch hands my mother tried smile tried look at me with love i craved but spite herself her face paled an expression horror congealed her features i stood there before her white with pasty whiteness prison my uncombed unkempt hair hanging about my shoulders my dress dirty wrinkled an unhealed cut ploughing a bloody furrow across my forehead question she dared not ask i touched ugly wound told her it was nothing nothing i could have told her that a soldier named izotov a fit animal temper had knocked me against edge cell door that cut had received absolutely no attention since had we been alone i should have wept whole story out on her breast but we were not alone standing over us like inquisitors were procureur petrograd terrible chkoni governor troubetskoy bastion afterwards governor fortress itself ten minutes only were allowed us at end eight fleeting minutes chkoni watch hand roared out two minutes left finish your talk but we had no talk sobs choked our words few commonplace words that such circumstances can be spoken we could only bid each other be brave trust god s mercy we could but gaze gaze at each other through streaming tears then they separated us when next friday came i resolved make myself a little more presentable i had no mirror but i begged woman loan me a small cracked fragment they had taken away all my toilet articles every single hairpin but woman gave me two hairpins her own combing my hair with my fingers i arranged it more less neatly every day i washed cared for cut on my forehead when visiting hour at last arrived i fancied that i looked rather more like myself this time precious ten minutes were spent with my father because he had been prepared advance for wretched object his daughter had become our brief interview was less emotional than that preceding friday brave erect my father held himself before those brutal jailers my heart glowed with love pride see him we managed exchange a few sentences my father told me that he had obtained permission send me money buy tea a few other comforts he told me that he my mother had waited three hours see me because it had been ruled that they could not both be admitted on same day that my mother was standing close door next room just catch faint sound my voice these words roused chkoni a perfect fury so he fairly yelled but i ll spoil that game rushing out he slammed door between two rooms my father flushed crimson but he spoke no word nor course did i a single protest might have meant punishment for me for us all no more visits i saw my father only three times my mother a little oftener as her health was better two money my father sent me did not reach me except very minute sums by far greater part it was kept by jailers gambled away not satisfied with that men warned my father that nothing except payment prison heads would save me from death worse still from assault by soldiers my father had long ago been deprived his income but he my mother sold some valuables gave it blackmailers who wanted it only for more gambling their sacrifice gave my parents a little peace mind but it did not save me from three most horrible nights i spent fortress on each these nights my cell was invaded by drunken soldiers who threatened me with unspeakable things on first occasion i simply groveled on wet floor prayed man name his mother mine let me alone drunk as he was my words actually penetrated his dark soul shamed it next men were less drunk but were far more bestial at sight them i threw myself against wall pounded frantically screaming at top my lungs mme soukhomlinoff heard understood she screamed too frightfully with all her might shook heavy door her cell this brought guard once more i was saved third time i was so paralyzed with fright that i could not scream i simply fell on my knees holding up my little ikon begged like a trapped animal man hesitated a moment spat on me contemptuously left next day half dead with shame fear i managed tell woman all that had passed indignantly she went governor fortress after that even i worst woman prison was spared ultimate insult although we could not know it things were gradually changing for better fortress a little physical improvement was apparent cold had lessened our short walks prison yard we could see that lovely spring with its fresh green leaves springing flowers had come stay i remember one day seeing grass a little yellow flower it may have been a buttercup a dandelion something else we ordinarily call weeds but my eyes it was an exquisite thing audaciously i stooped picked it hiding it quickly bosom my dress next visiting day i showed it my father dropped it on table on leaving room he contrived get hold it after his death i found it carefully preserved among his private papers i never picked another flower that prison yard although once i tried but this time a guard caught me struck flower from my hand with end his rifle things were improving under surface but aside from welcome change weather conditions seemed for a time no better cell adjoining that mme soukhomlinoff was my old friend general voyeikoff who was tortured almost as pitilessly as myself my heart ached for him cell was for some time police detective manouiloff but when he was removed another prison writer kolichko was placed cell kolichko poor wretch was so overcome by his arrest imprisonment that during first nights he sobbed so long bitterly that i found it impossible sleep i was so unhappy that i began pray for death once i even resolved end my life i had no weapon but a rusty needle which i had picked up carefully concealed but i had heard somewhere that there was a spot at base brain which if punctured ever so little would cause death before seeking that spot i felt that i must say adieu my brave little friend mme soukhomlinoff so softly i rapped out a farewell message on wall her quick mind instantly divined my intention without losing any time she sent for woman my rusty needle was taken away from me it began be sultry troubetskoy bastion air cells became thick foul my small window which looked out on a narrow court a high wall admitted little light no breeze at all i used climb painfully up on iron shelf which did duty for a table pressing my face close bars i breathed all air possible instead seeking warm corner my cell i now sat for hours together with my body against wettest coldest stones my despondency increased every day i almost ceased pray believe that universe held any god whom prayers captives could ascend yet all time god was sending me help one day a soldier came my cell roughly bade me get up go with two guards for examination not knowing exactly what that meant i rose from my cot followed men a room fortress where high commission inquiry appointed by kerensky was then session bewildered by sudden transition from bastion a room full comfortable furniture almost blinded by brilliant light sunshine i had all i could do answer their few inconsequential questions i have described this first examination another chapter i shall not repeat it here it was so foolish that afterwards my hot illsmelling cell i actually found myself laughing it had been a long time since i had laughed judge roudneff only one commission who showed himself fairminded even capable just judgment was present at inquiry but i do not think he said a word afterwards he was charged with full responsibility my case i appeared before him no less than fifteen times at close first these personal interviews i thanked judge roudneff warmly astonished he asked for what do thank me i answered for happiness four whole hours sitting a room with a window through it a glimpse green trees he did not reply except with a kind sympathetic look but i knew that his heart was touched that he received a new conception what life meant a prisoner better things still were come without our being aware it revolutionary mania had begun subside a little those men among our guards who had once been clean decent were now getting back their normal state mind poor soldiers never let me forget that they were not blame for torments they inflicted on me other prisoners it was not they who invented black calumnies that made me seem a creature undeserving mercy any clemency it was not they who fashioned cross on which i was crucified soldiers did only what they were incited do by men women far above them people who conspired crush me that they might crush empress soldiers i forgive but i cannot yet forgive those others fate imperial family ruin russia is on their souls for what they did they have never shown any penitence but those rough soldiers fortress repented did what they could atonement one head guards was a man handsome a rustic sort fashion who at first had treated me with great insolence one morning this man opened my door hesitated for a moment then said a low voice i am very sorry for please take this vanished this was an apple a small piece white bread another morning soldier who brought my breakfast spoke a grumbling aside but loudly enough for me hear what idiocy keep a poor sick woman this place one night window my cell door was pushed aside a trembling voice someone begged me give him my hand tears fell on it while unseen friend told me that he was a boy from samara that it broke his heart see women caged like beasts such holes he must have had a good mother that boy perhaps they all had for it became almost a habit for men passing through my corridor slip me bits bread sausage sugar most wonderful piece good fortune came through soldier charge prison library this man visited my cell one day after giving me a keen look which i could not understand he laid library catalogue on my cot went out i had little interest dull books at our disposal but when one sits hours utter idleness he makes occupation out almost nothing i opened catalogue turned leaves my astonishment out fell a folded paper cautiously i opened it read these words dear anushka i am sorry for if have five rubles i can get a letter your mother for a long time after incriminating paper had been destroyed i sat trembling doubt foreboding i had barely five rubles if i gave them would they be gambled away was letter a trap was it merely an effort get me into trouble i did not know but on a bit blank paper left catalogue i wrote with my stub a pencil i have suffered so much already that i cannot believe that wish do me any more harm folding five rubles paper into a tiny note i tucked it into catalogue waited after a while librarian returned this time i read his silent gaze that he was asking for my confidence next day he came back again left catalogue on my bed this time i seized it eagerly shook its leaves a letter from my mother dropped out a short letter for she had been given only a few minutes write but i read reread it until i knew every word by heart then began a smuggled correspondence with my father mother they gladly giving money men who risked their own liberty by carrying letters back forth letters reached me prison books sheets my bed under tin basin which held my food once even a soldier s sock dropped carelessly on floor this sock was concealed a note from lili dehn free now correspondence with family at tsarskoe selo there was a slip paper enclosed with a tiny white flower glued it empress s handwriting god keep another precious souvenir empress sent me by my mother was a little moonstone ring long ago given me at tsarskoe tearing a rag from lining my coat i made a bag for this jewel begging a safety pin from woman i pinned it inside my dress poor librarian this was last favor he ever did me for falling under suspicion governor he was abruptly discharged letters however had done me so much good that i was every way better more cheerful i felt touch with world again i knew a general way what was going on though not all news was pleasant it gave me a sense being alive not altogether hopeless i knew now what tireless efforts were being made my behalf i felt that end something must come them my parents had done everything humanly possible move kerensky but without any definite success first appointment with him was made through his secretary chalpern although my parents were naturally exactly on time kerensky kept them waiting for two hours when at last they were received my parents were told that empress alexandra feodorovna rasputine viroubova were responsible for revolution would have suffer for it my parents had heard this before but it was new them hear from kerensky that he knew that i had had a great many diamonds from archbishop pitirim for that other reasons nothing could be done for me later he softened a little ended interview by promising that my whole affair would be investigated my parents then contrived an interview with minister justice pereverzeff they made two appointments fact for first one pereverzeff deliberately broke going out for day while my parents sat waiting an anteroom next time my mother went ministry she was received was civilly treated pereverzeff also promised that a fair investigation would be made by this time special commission inquiry was sitting my mother managed see president mouravieff she took with her a letter from his brother me before abdication emperor this letter i was warned plots against me was advised leave palace i had replied this letter my mother had a copy my reply i had written that i would never leave empress my conscience was clean before god man i would remain end where god had placed me i was astonished that a soldier should advise me run away from a battlefield mouravieff who at first had been very harsh changed after reading letters he even asked my mother allow him read them commission they were significant he said as soon as my case had been referred judge roudneff he called my parents winter palace where he had his office talked with them asking a great many questions for nearly four hours this examination for it was really that my father mother were allowed for first time defend me make explanations obscure charges tell my life story man who was judge me no one else gave them such an opportunity not even georgian deputy cheidze then very prominent petrograd soviet cheidze was kind said that he would do anything his power help me get justice but i do not think he ever did anything members provisional government rodzianko lvoff whom while they were still power my parents had written begging be received never even replied letters one day sitting my cell remembering what had been written me smuggled letters another wonderful thing happened noon meal fish soup which i must eat starve i found a large piece really decent meat i ate it greedily course next day i ate another piece which had mysteriously arrived i took first opportunity ask woman where food came from she told me that it was a cook a poor man whose duty it was carry food our bastion he too pitied me she said she thought he might be willing run almost any risk for me so almost at once i was again correspondence with my parents this cook did more than carry letters brave man he brought me food chocolates clean clothes linen stockings even a fresh frock growing bolder he ventured regularly take away my soiled linen replace it with clean things all during those months fortress i had washed my linen stockings cold water without soap night had hung them up warm corner on a hook improvised from a broken hairpin course they were never clean nor even when i put them on very dry now they were stiff with dirt can anyone imagine what it was me feel a clean soft smooth chemise against my skin i am sure cook could never have done so much for me had not guards closed their eyes his activities they were nearly all friendly now used talk with me through window my door spring a number pigeons flocked around fortress their constant sobbing voices got on my nerves i spoke this one soldier who expressed surprise i was shut up here once he said under old government i didn t find birds bad at all i used feed them through window had a window your cell i exclaimed then it couldn t have been as bad as this he assured me that it wasn t as bad under autocracy as under beneficent provisional government soviet prisoners had much better food they could exercise two hours a day open another prisoner tsar s government a noncommissioned officer named diki who had been very harsh me beginning now showed me kindness instead robbing me as old every little privilege he began allow me an extra five minutes so courtyard he too saying that old days prisoners were better treated another guards courtyards a man whom i had bitterly hated with cause told woman that he wanted speak me afterwards while walking he approached me i looked into his coarse face deeply pitted with smallpox listened fear at what he might have say stammeringly he told me that he had just returned from a leave spent his home government saratoff visiting his sister s house he was amazed see hanging under ikon corner room a photograph me what he had exclaimed do have that shameless woman s picture your house whereupon his brotherinlaw retorted never dare speak against her who was like a mother me for two years tsarskoe i was her own hospital end it was like heaven brotherinlaw had charged guard with all kinds messages me telling him that they prayed for me daily his family hoped for my release forgive me for being unjust said poor soldier offered me his hand this was first news i had my hospital i learned with joy that provisional government had not closed it later i heard that government had not only carried on my work but had added five new buildings none my nurses orderlies had left though their openly expressed faith me might easily have secured their dismissal some invalids had petitioned duma for my release another group indignant because a revolutionary newspaper declined publish their letter refuting usual slanders about me wanted leave hospital long enough blow up office building they were good at heart those misguided russian soldiers those poor ignorant children i know them whatever they have been forced do these years horror i still believe them sound good soul last days my imprisonment peter paul guards did not even lock my cell door they used linger talk sometimes they brought paper pencils that i might make sketches them take home i was rather clever with a pencil those days chapter xviii prison had changed except for an occasional riot a fight between two drinking soldiers it was almost peaceful for now there was a man attached fortress a man so brave kind above all so commanding that terrors fled before himdr ivan manouchine gratitude respect with which i write his name cannot be expressed words it was on rd april name day empress ever a day memories me that this good man came into house pain where lay prisoners provisional government a few weeks before this soldiers gradually recovering from their first revolutionary blood lust had begun revolt against needless brutality prison doctor serebrianikoff had finally sent all powerful kerensky a request for his demission those days kerensky whose ambition be at head government was maturing made a special point granting soldiers petitions he really consented replace serebrianikoff with a physician reputation from point view duma dr manouchine was entirely a safe man be appointed he was a republican politics he conformed popular superstition dark forces surrounding court but what duma did not know about dr manouchine was that he had a heart gold a mind that was ruled not by any political party but by principles right justice when new prison doctor first came into my cell accompanied by retiring man looking frightened ill at ease i was lying on my cot a mood unusual rebellion a quiet professional voice he asked me how i felt when he examined my poor chest saw it black blue swollen from clumsy cupping it had received he frowned with displeasure he gave some quick directions for my relief a gentle tone assured me that he intended visit bastion every day it was first time many long weeks that i had been spoken by type man we call a gentleman after door closed behind him something my frozen heart seemed melt like icicles sun almost with faith childhood i fell on my knees prayed after that i lay down slept for several hours every day soon after booming noonday gun he came every one among us stood up as close as possible cell doors waiting catch first sound his voice as he came down corridor at every door he stopped asked health prisoner him they were not prisoners but patients he treated them with all skill above all courtesy he would have accorded richest most powerful his patients he examined our food pronounced it entirely unsuited our needs he did not stop there but end succeeded greatly improving ration supplementing it for sick with milk eggs how he did it russia those days i cannot imagine i only know that dr manouchine had a will steel against that will staunch uprightness his character malice fanaticism broke like waves against a rock little by little dr manouchine instituted other reforms prisoners now received at least a part money furnished by their friends outside once a week noncommissioned officer diki went through prison answering requests for such necessities as soap tooth powder paper on which petitions governor fortress might be written often when a prisoner lacked money pay for these things doctor supplied it out his own pocket meanwhile my examinations under stern but just commissioner roudneff were going on weary under long apparently pointless inquisition i asked dr manouchine one day how much longer he thought they intended torment me his reply was grave not long i think but before it is over may have undergo a still more trying ordeal a few day later he came my cell alone that is he resolutely closed door between us his usual escort soldiers told me his kindest manner that special commission inquiry had almost concluded that charges against me were without foundation one more proof however was necessary a physician s sworn statement that hideous accusations vice made by enemies emperor empress their closest friends were false would i for my own sake for sake imperial family submit a medical examination without at all knowing what was implied i gave an instant but rather frightened consent any examination he thought necessary it was a terrible ordeal for a woman live through most questions asked me were a nature which appalled me yet were beyond my understanding i cannot here repeat even least them i can only say that they opened up me an abyss wickedness sin which i had not dreamed existed human soul at end an houror many hoursof trial i lay on my bed hands clasped over my eyes spent exhausted utterly incapable speech up very end dr manouchine s manner had been that a physician but now that it was over it was a friend beyond anything human sympathetic who laid his hand on my quivering shoulder said this clears absolutely they will take my word for it towards end may a hot wearying season fortress was visited by head provisional government s commission inquiry a pompous man yet his cautious way rather kindly pausing before my cell he told me that no crime had been fastened upon me that i might hope soon be transferred a better place hope gave me new life momentarily but as days dragged on my hope gave way bitter unbelief my health always since my arrest indifferent now began decline i could see that doctor was seriously concerned for me he came prison only four times a week now what ages seemed elapse between his visits all i had left courage his voice ministrations gave me one hot june day i was aroused from my sick lethargy by tramping heavy boots on stones corridor heavy cell door swung open i saw a crowd strange men several whom unceremoniously invaded my cell began an examination my poor effects frightened i watched them as they disdainfully picked up threw aside few rags a prisoner is allowed but my fears were allayed when i saw background tall figure doctor do not be afraid anna alexandrovna he said this is only a committee revision prisoners later i heard him say committee this woman may have only a few days live if are willing may take on yourselves responsibility her death as a physician i refuse do so next day he whispered me that he was confident that i would be taken away but that my release might be delayed a little because renewed riots among prison guards he did not know where i was be taken i feared it would be women s prison which woman had told me was almost as bad as troubetskoy bastion but soon i was relieved that nightmare for doctor came again bringing me good news that i should probably be taken house detention a pleasant neighborhood on other side river groups friendly soldiers came say goodbye assure me that even should mutinous guards oppose my going they would see it that i got safely way days went by sleepless nights still no order release arrived i became almost hysterical with suspense i gave way dreadful fits weeping until even doctor grew stern bade me control myself i felt like a mouse under teasing claws a cat control was difficult even after i learned that doctor had persuaded some members central committee petrograd soviet visit fortress reason with mutinous guards almost last day june at six evening i was standing barefooted half dressed against cool wet wall my cell thinking my mother who day before had visited me her face was brighter than usual she had said me next time we meet it may be better circumstances at moment my door opened hated chkoni appeared well he said with his usual sneer did have hysterics after seeing your mother certainly not i replied coldly no he commented i thought might because tomorrow next day they may take away i fell against wall too overcome speak too blind see hands guard pressing my limp hand congratulation tomorrow next day words repeated themselves my brain countless times but i was not even wait until tomorrow though chkoni evidently wished me think so i heard voice younger less familiar wardress dress yourself quickly doctor is bringing a deputation from soviet i had nothing put on except my ragged shoes a torn gray woolen jacket but these i rapidly seized while wardress picked up made a bundle my small belongings on opposite wall i heard brave mme soukhomlinoff rapping out a farewell message which i responded as well as i could then deputation arrived doctor there was some confused talk i cannot remember a word i felt myself picked up carried down winding corridors great door bastion rolled open we passed out into cool delicious evening air there was a motor car into which i was lifted another car into which doctor climbed there were soldiers some friendly some seemingly determined that cars should not leave courtyard i remember very little until we drove out gates over troizky bridge wind brilliant twilight sight water blue sky blinded me so that i had cover my face with both hands within a short time cars stopped at detention house fourshkatskaia ulitza i was carried into office commissioner he was an officer rather short stature but dignified efficient offering me his hand he asked me if i would be seated while he made out necessary papers i had time see that house detention promised be quite different from a prison indeed soldiers this house would not even permit entrance fortress guards who had come with me as if he divined that i was too weak walk upstairs commissioner gave orders that i was be carried it was into a large light clean room that they took me at my exclamation joy at sight windows soldiers laughed heartily but doctor silenced them go he said see that her parents are telephoned send a woman bathe dress her his own arms lifted me from chair on which i half sat half lay on a bed softer cooler than even existed my memory he laid me said good night gently left room chapter xix i spent a happy peaceful month detention house only disturbing event being socalled july revolution first serious attempt lenine s party seize government soviet already transcended power old provisional government most whose original members had by this time disappeared from politics kerensky was premier nominally but only because a remnant russian army still resisted separate peace propaganda remained on duty at front persons detention house were prisoners sense that they were under guard were not allowed leave house guards were complacent though visiting between rooms was permitted i soon found that i was only woman place that some men there had suffered greater tortures than i there were between eighty ninety officers almost last remnant garrison kronstadt where first days revolution soldiers went quite mad murdered ways too horrible relate a great many officers even young naval cadets against whom they could have had no possible grudge officers detention house were a sad state body mind we talked together sometimes dining room learning that they longed for consolation holy communion i remembered that my hospital tsarskoe selo possessed a movable altar holy vessels with consent nadjaroff commandant detention house altar my own priest were brought from tsarskoe sacred ceremony was twice celebrated last time on july my birthday i ought say commandant nadjaroff that he was an excellent man kind prisoners conscientious his work poor man had one fatal weakness gambling so strong a hold had this vice on an otherwise good man that when his money ran short he was not above borrowing even begging from prisoners their friends it seems almost too bad record this blot on character a man who was kind courteous me but i am trying give psychology as well as portray events russian revolution i must emphasize fact that it was weakness selfindulgence people themselves that made revolution its frightful aftermath possible from my first day detention house i began recover my health my selfcontrol my windows were not barred through open casement i feasted my eyes on beauty grass trees on familiar little church sts kosma damian which stood almost opposite strangest all me people walking driving through streets below it took a few days for me get used a normal state life at first when night grew near i was seized with such nervousness that they had let a maid sleep room with me as fresh air sunshine began bring color my face i felt strength returning my limbs i forgot my fears became something like woman i had been before i was caged like a beast fortress peter paul visitors were admitted both morning afternoon i had happiness talking privately with my father mother with friends who still remained faithful they brought me clothes toilet articles books flowers writing materials best all news what had happened during months my imprisonment i learned rapid disintegration army under weak ineffectual provisional government tottering state kerensky s rgime threatening domination soviets what was store for russia no one knew happily for russians fall soviets rise bolshevism no one yet had any premonition radical element was already control there was a great deal threatening talk shooting emperor however imperial family was still alive tsarskoe selo which was as much as i had dared hope events july revolution forerunner bolshevist triumph november i know rather less than others who were at full liberty during that terrible week it was about th month a brilliant summer day when i was startled by longcontinued shouting bellowing soldiers a caserne not far from house great excitement men were running out yard calling on tovarishi arm themselves join uprising as if by magic streets filled with roughlooking people singing wild songs waving their arms forming processions behind huge scarlet banners on which i could read such inscriptions as down with war down with provisional government an endless line these paraders passed repassed dirty disorderly soldiers equally dirty factory workers yelling like crazed animals once a while a gray motor truck would dash through street laden with shouting men boys rifles machine guns distance we could hear shots ripping noise machine guns course we were all horribly frightened especially officers from kronstadt who knew that case invasion not one them would be left alive we were all advised leave our rooms take refuge corridors as at any time rioters might begin firing through windows but we were not out danger even there because many guards openly sympathized with rioters head guard was so jubilant over course events that he went around boasting that he was quite prepared surrender house all its inmates at first demand revolutionists some guards were better than this man one them a wearer st george cross said that case trouble he would try get me his sister s house where i would be perfectly safe for two nights nobody slept even undressed room next mine was lodged old general belaieff former war minister whom imprisonment had left a sad wreck he like other officers fully expected death i found myself novel rle a cool collected comforter i who illustration grand duchesses olga tatiana anastasie marie prisoners at tsarskoe selo illustration anna viroubova a photograph taken shortly after her release from fortress peter paul petrograd had lately been afraid sleep a room by myself now went from one old soldier another urging them keep up hope days passed firing came no nearer within a week troops summoned from front took possession city my examination under high commissioner roudneff not being entirely finished he came once twice detention house bringing with him on one occasion korinsky procurator petrograd a courteous gentleman who at parting expressed a hope that i would soon be free a few days later august if i remember correctly m korinsky himself telephoned that if my parents would call at his office they would be given my warrant release alas my parents happened be terioke that day but too impatient wait until morrow i telephoned my uncle lachkereff who immediately hastened procurator s office for coveted warrant trembling with excitement i stood at my window with several my good friends waiting result his errand at six o clock we heard a drosky driven at great speed over cobbles as it came sight we saw my uncle standing up wildly waving papers his hand free he called out anna alexandrovna are free rest is confusion my mind there were laughter sobs people kissed embraced me i was drosky driving through petrograd streets i was my uncle s house tea table was spread it was like a dream after prison one gets used freedom by slow degrees it seems strange at first be allowed move about freely go church walk drive go wherever one desires through woods along leafy country roads not that i was entirely free go where i liked i could not safely go tsarskoe selo even my own house which after my arrest had been taken over by police not only ransacked for evidence against me but looted every valuable it was my faithful old servant berchik who gave me details search he honest soul who had been fortyfive years service my family was offered ten thousand rubles if he would testify against empress myself on his indignant refusal police arrested him while they tore up carpets even floors my rooms demanding berchik whereabouts secret passages palace private telegraph telephone wires berlin my hidden writing desks all sorts nonsense especially were they anxious discover my wine cellar when they found that i possessed none they were angry indeed they took possession all letters papers they could find at end search ordered my cook prepare them an elaborate supper then they left taking with them silverware if i could not visit tsarskoe those whom i loved longed see i could at least i did hear from empress just before family were sent their exile one maids smuggled out a letter which reached me safely which i quote here suppressing only most intimate affectionate passages i cannot write much letter began my heart is too full i love we love thank bless kiss wound on your forehead i cannot find words i know what will be your anguish with this great distance between us they do not tell us where we go we shall learn only on train nor for how long but we think it is where were last tobolsk beloved misery leaving everything packed up empty rooms such pain home twentythree years yet have suffered far more farewell somehow let me know received this we prayed long before virgin znomenia i remembered last time it was on your bed my heart soul are torn go so far from home from be for months without news is terrible but god is merciful he won t forsake will bring us together again sunny times i fully believe it with letter empress sent me a box my jewels which she had carefully guarded i heard a fairly full account how summer had been spent for a time she emperor had been kept apart being allowed speak each other only at table presence guards revolutionary agents tried every possible means incriminating empress whom they hated even more than emperor but finally failing their efforts they allowed family be together once more day after they were sent siberia maid visited me again with story their departure kerensky personally arranged every detail intruded his presence for hours together on unhappy family under his orders everything was made ready for a midnight journey but actually they did not leave palace until six o clock morning all night prisoners sat their traveling clothes wraps round hall palace at five a courageous servant brought them fresh tea which gave them a little comfort especially alexei who stood night badly they drove away from palace with perfect serenity as if going on a holiday finland crimea even revolutionary newspapers with grudging admiration had admit this a day two later mr gibbs alexei s english tutor came see me he told me that although he was not permitted accompany imperial family with other tutors m gilliard m petroff he intended follow them tobolsk he took a photograph me for empress who was anxious see for herself if long imprisonment had impaired my health as a matter fact i was not very well just then as i had something very like jaundice so i am afraid my photograph was none too reassuring at this time i was staying home my sister s husband who was attached british military commission petrograd it was a cool comfortable apartment i should have been contented stay on indefinitely but one day my brotherinlaw deep embarrassment showed me a letter from his sister who was expected on a visit this lady expressed herself unwilling live under same roof with a person as notorious as myself i equally unwilling associate with her moved back my uncle s hospitable home but even there i found no serenity i had been acquitted all crimes charged against me by provisional government but now government kerensky found new accusations make me this time i was a counterrevolutionist as papers served on me middle night august russian ordered i had leave for an unknown destination within twentyfour hours as i was without money was really need a physician s care my relatives began at once petition every authority for a delay at least twentyfour hours more this was finally allowed but two soldiers were immediately placed before my door i was a prisoner my uncle s apartment meanwhile my parents friends continued make every preparation for my comfort exile two my hospital staff director a nurse volunteered go with me night before i left my poor parents stayed with me none us going bed very early on a rainy morning two motor cars filled with police came for us they were kind enough let my parents accompany me almost finnish side they explained that they had come so early because they feared street demonstrations at station we found a miscellaneous company alleged counterrevolutionists including a few old acquaintances among these was former detective manouiloff a tall officer named groten editor tanchevsky curious little siberian doctor badmieff with his equally curious wife child a young maid named erika whom i came know very well badmieff was herb doctor who it will be remembered was supposed purvey deadly poisons which i was alleged feed tsarevitch he was a small round shriveled man excessively oldover a hundred they saidand appearance resembled a quaint carved buddha out an antiquarian shop he had smallest blackest eyes imaginable set a face yellow wrinkled his long scraggly beard was as white as cotton his wife many years his junior his funny little child aida were as mongolian appearance as himself maid erika a girl about eighteen was not uncomely with her bright eyes short curly hair all counterrevolutionists were herded together one carriage one farthest from engine charge us was a jewish official kerensky government at terioke i parted with my father mother train moving on quickly finnish town belieovstrov here we were met by an enormous crowd soldiers working people all hostile demanding see dangerous counterrevolutionists especially they demanded see me but i shrank back my seat fearing every moment that shower stones against carriage would break windows but quickly conductor s whistle was blown train moved beyond reach mob worse was come when we reached rikimeaki we found waiting us a larger a still more furious crowd our carriage was unfastened from train mob rushed yelling that we must all be given up killed give us grand dukes they shouted give us gourko i sat with my face buried shoulder my nursing sister fearing that my end had come my fears were not imaginary for several ruffians pitched on me shouting that they had found gourko women s clothes frantically sister explained that i was not general gourko but only a woman ill lame refusing believe her they demanded that i be stripped i have no doubt that this would have happened had not a motor car opportunely dashed up carrying a sailor deputation from helsingfors soviet these men pushed their way into carriage without ceremony booted invaders out one man a tall slender youth named antonoff made a speech at top his voice commanding mob disperse leave things hands soviet so authoritatively did he speak that crowd obeyed him allowed our carriage be attached another train bound for helsingfors antonoff remained with us friendliest fashion sat down beside me bade me be good cheer he did not know why we had been sent away from petrograd but soviet at helsingfors which he was a member had received a telegram he thought directly from kerensky saying that we were being sent on when we arrived were be placed under arrest doubtless there would be explanations after that we would surely be released my mind thing seemed not quite so simple kerensky had sent us from petrograd but not be imprisoned helsingfors what he desired was that mobs notified our arrival from his office would kill us before we ever reached helsingfors at all no doubt he hoped at same time dispose general gourko grand dukes left petrograd but gourko was too clever for kerensky made good his escape archangel where he took refuge with british occupational force as for grand dukes they were for some reason at this time left undisturbed by revolutionists it was night when we reached helsingfors we found station practically deserted main body prisoners were taken away into darkness but antonoff said that i nurse should spend night a hospital adjoining station we climbed several flights steep stairs passed through wards crowded with bluegowned sick soldiers sailors not one whom offered us slightest rudeness a skilled finnish nurse undressed me put me bed but unhappily not for long scarcely had i composed myself sleep when door opened lights flashed up antonoff red very angry entered room he had gone soviet authorities confident that he could persuade them let me remain hospital at least until word came from petrograd our exact status but they refused his request ordered him take me at once ship on which other prisoners were confined there being no appeal i dressed limped down long stairs street where a dense mob had assembled shouting threatening crowding dangerously around motor car it is a horrible thing hear a mob shrieking for one s blood one feels like a cornered hare face yelping hounds with strength desperation i clung arm antonoff who for all i knew might yield suddenly throw me crowd unworthy thought for man held me firmly all time demanding that people give room let us reach car when they saw me car their fury seemed redouble daughter romanoffs they yelled how dare she ride a motor car let her get out walk standing up car antonoff repeated his commands that mob disperse slowly at first then more rapidly we got away we reached distant water front i was taken from car a ship picture my astonishment when i found myself standing on deck polar star light beautiful yacht on which i had so often sailed finnish waters with imperial family with all imperial property polar star had been confiscated by provisional government it was but another sign changing times that yacht had later been taken away from provisional government was now property soviets being zentrobalt headquarters baltic fleet from deck i was hurried past open door main dining salon once a place ceremony good living now a dingy disordered apartment where crowds illiterate workmen gathered dispose rest russia s ruined fleet future our unhappy country at least a hundred these men were salon when i passed it first during five days i spent on yacht their voices seemed go on endless orations ceaseless wrangling twentyfour hours at a stretch it was like nothing i can describe like an illdisciplined lunatic asylum i was herded with other counterrevolutionists far below decks what i conjectured had been stokers quarters stifling little cabins were filthy like all rest yacht they simply swarmed with vermin it was so dark that night day electric lights burned i was thankful for that because somehow bright light seemed be a kind protection against swarm grimacing obscene sailors who infested place amusing themselves with discussions as when how we were likely be killed during whole first night antonoff stood guard over us warned sailors that no murder could be done without authority from soviet over over again they suggested that he leave place but he always replied firmly that he was responsible for prisoners could not go finally towards morning sailors left afterwards we learned that their blood lust towards us was not merely simulated they had gone directly from yacht petropavlovsk flagship fleet had killed every one old officers left on board antonoff left us early morning left us expecting return but he never did return nor did we ever see hear him again such sudden disappearances were common enough even those early days russian revolution before murder became fine art into which it has since developed five days we remained on polar star very miserable our vermininfested quarters below decks but mercifully allowed part each day open air they might have allowed us longer time on deck had it not been for hostile crowds that constantly thronged quays my time was spent shelter deckhouse near main salon a spot where old days empress i loved sit with our books work here five years before when empress dowager visited yacht i had taken a photograph her with her arm around shoulders emperor both smiling happy sparkling light fjord every corner yacht had been exquisitely clean white those days dirty as yacht s present crew appeared i cannot say they starved their prisoners were cruel them we had soup meat bread tea luxurious fare compared peter paul our worst condition was suspense mind as our ultimate fate at every change guard we begged news from petrograd but always we received same answer kerensky government gave no reason justification for our arrest two sailors were especially friendly me because as they explained they came from rojdestino our family estate near moscow if we had known that were going be brought here they said we might have done something but now it is too late that night i found my cabin a tiny note illspelled badly written warning me that all us were about be transferred fortress sveaborg bay helsingfors we are so sorry note concluded although it was unsigned i knew note must have been sent kindness by one men from my old home but at prospect another imprisonment my heart turned sick with dread next evening came ostrovsky head helsingfors okhrana accompanied by several members main committee soviet ostrovsky was a very young man scarcely eighteen i should judge but he had fierce eyes all assurance a born leader turning my nurse mme badmieff erika maid her little mongolian charge aida he said roughly that they were free but that all rest would be taken at once fortress a sudden panic alarm i threw myself into arms my nursing sister begged her accompany me but she too was fearstricken drew back while all men laughed heartlessly what s difference asked ostrovsky brutally re all going be shot anyhow at which dauntless erika putting aida into her mother s arms came over me tucking her hand under my arms said i m not afraid i m going wherever doctor goes i ll stand by both i gave trembling nurse a small box containing all trinkets i had brought with me gave her messages my father mother followed my fellow unfortunates deck down a slippery gangplank waiting motor boats on which we traveled half hour s journey from yacht fortress chapter xx sveaborg before war was one three principal naval stations russian empire other two being kronstadt reval sveaborg occupies a number small islands bay helsingfors bay itself shaped like a rather narrow half moon is so enclosed by these wooded islands that winter salt water freezes solidly summer islands are green lovely a few them not under military control are used by finns as pleasure resorts even darkness unfortuitous circumstances our arrival i could see that main island might be a very attractive place up a steep hill we panted past a white church surrounded with trees at last reached place our confinement a long dingy onestoried stronghold a young officer several very dirty soldiers took our records erika i were pushed into a small cell with two wooden bunks covered with dust alas nothing else place smelled as only old prisons do smell only air came through a small window high one walls wrapping ourselves our coats we lay down on hard planks tried sleep early dawn we got up our backs aching our throats choked with dust but irrepressible erika laughed so heartily sneezed so comically that i found it impossible lament our surroundings place was a dreadful hole just same no proper toilet facilities at hand course no opportunity washing say nothing bathing we had pay for our food at rate about ten rubles a day at that time no small amount money food was not very bad except that stepan commissary used wipe our plates with a disgustingly dirty towel which he wore around his neck same towel being used a laudable attempt wipe dust from our bunks climbing on bunks we had a view through window a new building going up workmen being women as well as men at same time we got a glimpse detective manouiloff who ever pessimistic held up three fingers as an expression his belief that we had only that many days live we however ventured guess that we would not remain at sveaborg more than a month it was a mere hazard but it turned out a fortunate one we remained just about a month it was a queer life we lived during that month surrounded by tipsy irresponsible men whose officers seemed fear them too much insist upon discipline officers especially one fine young man did everything they dared make us comfortable after first ten days our plank beds were furnished with green leather cushions which might have made sleep a comfort if they had not persisted slipping from under us about as soon as we dozed off somewhat later a week perhaps before our liberation these cushions were replaced by real mattresses stuffed with seaweed wonderfully luxurious by comparison with bare boards prisoners were exercised every day open under sveaborg guards gaze a crowd finnish bolshevists these people seemed at first immensely diverted by pomposity siberian doctor badmieff who his long white robe tall cap white gloves was certainly a curious spectacle soon they tired him turned their stolid expressionless eyes on other prisoners with what intentions we could only conjecture badmieff continued be a center interest prison erika his faithful disciple demanded privilege attending him this was granted every day he sat crosslegged like buddha he so much resembled dictating endless medical treatises erika evenings he used put his lamp on floor at foot his bunk strew around it flowers leaves brought from outside burn some kind illsmelling herbs for incense generally create what i assumed be occult atmosphere his beloved thibet erika scantily clad always attended these sances gradually they appeared hypnotize sailors who thought highly doctor s professional powers indeed towards end i often heard them swearing that whoever left fortress they would at least keep their highly esteemed tovarish badmieff his siberianthibetan lore sad contrast condition dr badmieff was that poor editor glinka janchevsky who being without money was treated with utmost contempt housed a wretched cell covered with obscene drawings miserable man spent most his time lying on his wooden bed wrapped up head all his overcoat he used creep our cell door with a glass hot water his hand begging for a pinch tea if we had it a little sugar every day he used ask pathetically when do think we shall be let go like all journalists he was famished for news whenever i got hold a stray newspaper i used read it him from first column last vacillating conduct bolshevist sailors toward prisoners kerensky i can only ascribe increasingly bitter conflict going on between weak provisional government bolsheviki sailors hated us because we were bourgeois but they spared us because kerensky desired our destruction officers goodnaturedly brought me flowers from outside an occasional newspaper even letters from people helsingfors who knew my history pitied my fate sometimes i was even invited tea with officers twice i was taken out prison ostensibly for examination but really attend services at little white church on island guards were rough kind by turns sometimes uttering horrible threats against all prisoners sometimes bringing me a handful wild flowers they knew i loved have near me discipline was lax we never knew from one day another what might befall for example padlock my cell got lost for several nights door was left unlocked one can imagine how i slept on one these unguarded nights cell was invaded by a group drunken lustful men erika i fought them screaming at top our lungs until a few sober betterminded sailors came rescue a day two later when a rumor spread that we were all be hanged i among first i for one felt less terror than relief anything even hanging seemed better than this lunatic prison where guards drank played cards wrangled all night where men s attitude towards erika myself only women was by turns dangerously savage dangerously friendly besides kerensky prisoners fortress sheltered eight nine prisoners charged with crimes ranging from theft murder some these whom we encountered exercise yard looked like very decent men shining perhaps by contrast with rowdy revolutionists i had seen course two imprisonments for these unfortunates for guards we bought cigarettes thus establishing more cordial relations nobody knew could guess what was going happen us one day appeared president helsingfors soviet a blackeyed jew named sheiman who assured us that we were be sent back petrograd that we might as well have our things ready by nine o clock that night nothing happened that night nor did we for some reason expect anything next day sheiman came again with his bodyguard soldiers sailors told us that his soviet refused for a time release us it appeared that telegrams had arrived from kerensky from cheidze georgian leader petrograd soviet urgently demanding our return helsingfors soviet might have obliged cheidze but they would not honor any demand kerensky s so there we were provisional government petrograd soviet sent over several deputies kaplan a small blackbearded man who smilingly told us that there was no possible hope for us sokoloff famous rather infamous author first instance order no which was principally responsible for breakup army joffe little jew who a few years later became influential enough be included among delegates genoa conference after their visit i don t know why prison discipline became still further relaxed we had visitors attention physicians if we needed it we were informed that henceforth we would not be regarded as prisoners at all but only as persons temporarily detained two hours a day after this we were allowed open air i became very friendly with finnish women carpenters at work on new building on our island these good souls brought me bottles delicious milk one day building foreman a moscow russian invited me his house tea here i a poor prisoner was treated with such deference that i was actually embarrassed not one family would eat with me even sit down my presence at this time erika i were given a more commodious cell furnished with seaweed mattresses which i have spoken but our horror we found walls covered with most frightful scrawls pictures sailor guards however brought water sponges with many apologies washed off disgusting records as well as they could i was thankful for this a few days later when all unexpectedly i received a visit from my dear mother it had been some days after our parting at frontier before she my father learned that i was prison immediately they had gone helsingfors appeal general stachovitch governor finland but he advised them avoid trouble for themselves perhaps for me also by going quietly back petrograd my parents gave him money for me which i never received despite governor s advice they stayed on helsingfors faint hope seeing me dr manouchine my mother told me had returned from a long visit caucasus was doing what he could get me released my mother also gave me news last struggle maintain army conflict between korniloff kerensky ending as everyone knows death korniloff these two were about equally hated by sveaborg sailors who would gladly have murdered them both they had begun speak with unbounded admiration lenine trotzky especially lenine who they declared was coming saviour russia bolshevism was air for a moment it assumed a really benevolent aspect i remember a deputation kronstadt bolshevists who came sveaborg inspect us review our entire case some these men were very civil me asking many questions about imperial family life court at parting one said me navely are quite different from what i thought d be i shall tell comrades so very next day another deputation came characteristic confused state public mind these men were as brutal as others had been kind they stormed down prison corridors roaring where is viroubova show us viroubova i cowered my cell but when guard came admonished me for my own safety show myself men i gathered courage speak them totally unprepared see terrible viroubova merely a crippled woman a shabby frock men suddenly quieted down made civil response my words we didn t know that were ill said one men as they prepared move on although we did not know it at time our fate really hung on outcome a congress soviets which was then being held petrograd which both sheiman ostrovsky were delegates sheiman returned helsingfors visiting my cell told me that both trotzky lounacharsky were insistent on release kerensky s prisoners that evening he said would be held a secret session executives helsingfors soviet at which he would urge recommendation trotzky lounacharsky if executives agreed question would then be referred entire soviet made up principally sailors old baltic fleet that evening i was invited tea officers quarters while sitting there telephone rang it is for said officer who answered call i picked up receiver heard sheiman s voice saying briefly executive has voted unanimously for release prisoners there was little sleep for me that night but tired as i was by morning i greeted happily unkempt cook his messy breakfast plate all day i waited with dumb patience only prisoners know at early evening i was rewarded by appearance sheiman ostrovsky put on your coat follow me said sheiman i have resolved take on my own responsibility hospital my nursing sister who had spent afternoon with me he gave orders go helsingfors wait for further directions at prison gate sheiman signed necessary papers hurrying me past two gaping bolshevist soldiers he led way down a bypath water boarding a small motor launch manned by a single sailor we started off at high speed for helsingfors there was one bad moment when we approached a low bridge occupied by a strong guard but at sheiman s directions uttered a short whisper i lay down flat launch we passed unchallenged first stars were shining clear autumn sky as we reached military quay town we ran under lee a huge warship stepped ashore there was a motor car waiting chauffeur who evidently knew his business started his engine without a word even a turn his head sheiman spoke only one sentence tovarish nicholai drive naming a street number at once we were off my head fairly swimming at sight electric lights shaded streets people walking up down turning into a quiet street we left car all three us shaking hands with discreet driver bidding ostrovsky find my nurse my small luggage sheiman conducted me door hospital where a nice clean finnish nurse took me charge put me bed one freshest airiest most comfortable rooms i have ever occupied take good care this lady were last words president helsingfors soviet let no one intrude on her his words assured smile nurse were good soporifics i fell almost instantly into a deep sleep two days later september russian sheiman came see me with news that trotzky had ordered all kerensky prisoners back petrograd that he sheiman had personally seen it that my nurse my aunt who was at that time helsingfors were accompany me sheiman himself also ostrovsky who was unfortunately very drunk went with us train which left helsingfors that same night about half past ten it was an unpleasant journey prisoners being a state wild excitement many redbadged officers more less tipsy with my aunt nurse i sat a corner a dirty compartment praying for day come at nine morning we reached petrograd sheiman still solicitous my welfare escorted three us smolny institute once an aristocratic school for girls now headquarters petrograd soviet here i had happiness once more embrace my mother who with relatives other prisoners waited our arrival many soviet authorities were place among others kameneff a small redbearded man his wife a sister renowned trotzky both kameneffs were extremely kind us seeing that my companions i had tea food expressing hope that i should soon be out trouble kameneff telephoned kerensky s headquarters asking leave send us home but as it was a holiday nobody answered call well go home anyhow said kameneff leaving telephone but sokolov stopped us long enough make us understand that prisoners all had appear next day before high commission winter palace i never saw kameneffs again even thank them for their kindness but i read kerensky newspapers that i was on terms intimacy with them was therefore a bolshevist it was even stated that i was a close friend afterwards notorious woman commissar kolantai whom i have never seen that trotzky was a familiar visitor my house thus ended my second term imprisonment first i was arrested as a german spy intrigant next as a counterrevolutionary now i was accused being a bolshevist name trotzky instead rasputine was linked with mine hardly knowing what next was store for me i reported at once high commission here i was told that their inquiries concerning me were finished that i had better see minister interior at this ministry i was informed that i was no immediate danger but that i would remain under police surveillance i asked why but got no satisfactory answer later i learned that tottering provisional government wanted send me all counterrevolutionists archangel but this move dr manouchine who was still very influential was determined prevent from my uncle s house where i had first taken refuge i moved a discreet lodging heart city from this place i never once daylight ventured out this was late october bolshevist revolution had begun deadly earnest day after day i sat listening sound rifle shots putter machine guns pounding armored cars over stone pavements tramp tramp tramp soldiers russia was getting ready for long promised constitutional convention which turned out be a communist coup d tat once a while husband my landlady a naval man came my lodgings it was he who gave me news arrest provisional government siege winter palace ignominious collapse kerensky while women soldiers fought died hide his flight scenes streets as they were described me were appalling soon it was decided that my retreat was too near center hostilities be at all safe about end october i was taken by night a distant quarter town tiny apartment an old woman formerly a masseuse my hospital here came our old servant berchik keen protect me from danger here we stayed for a month when my mother found me a still safer lodging on sixth floor a house fourtchkatskaia a cozy little apartment whose windows gave a pleasant view roofs church steeples there for eight months i lived like a recluse once a great while venturing go church well guarded by berchik nurse bolshevik government seemed successfully established its policy blood terror extermination was well under way yet my hidden retreat it seemed me that for a time at least i was forgotten my troubles were all over chapter xxi paradoxical though it may appear last months winter spent a hidden lodging turbulent petrograd were more peaceful than any period i had known since revolution began i knew that city country were hands fanatic bolshevists that under their ruthless theory government no human life was at all secure food fuel were scarce dear there was no doubt that things were destined grow worse long before they could any imaginable circumstances grow better wreck army was complete while war still waged western europe we who had had so much do with defiance german militarism were completely out final struggle peace my soul was partly born ignorance i suppose ignorance events shared by everyone not immediately contact with world catastrophe i was free i lived a comfortable apartment my dear father mother came daily see me two my faithful old servants lived with me were ready protect me from all enemies also because mind cannot fully realize worst i believed that russian chaos was a temporary manifestation i thought i saw signs a reaction favor exiled emperor this i was certainly encouraged by two oldest most prominent revolutionists known outside world bourtseff a leader among old social revolutionaries novelist gorky it was december if i remember correctly that i learned that gorky was anxious meet me as i preferred keep my small corner safety as free from visitors as possible i made an appointment with novelist his own home a modest apartment on petrograd side neva not far from fortress gorky whose gaunt features are familiar all readers is said be a sufferer from tuberculosis but as he has lived many years since first rumors this disease were circulated there may be some reason doubt his affliction that he is a sick man none can doubt for his high cheek bones seem almost pierce his colorless skin his darkly luminous eyes are deeply sunken his head for two hours this first interview i sat conversation with gorky strange creature who at times seems be heart soul a bolshevist at other times openly expresses his loathing disgust their insane destructive policies me gorky was gentle sympathetic what he said about emperor empress filled my heart with encouragement hope they were he declared poor scapegoats revolution martyrs fanaticism time he had examined with care private apartments palace he saw clearly that these unhappy ones were not even what are called aristocrats but merely a bourgeois family devoted each other their children as well as their ideals righteous living he expressed himself as bitterly disappointed revolution character russian proletariat earnestly he advised me live as quietly as possible never reminding bolshevist authorities any strangers my existence my duty he told me was live devote myself writing true story lives emperor empress owe this russia he said for what can write may help bring peace between emperor people twice afterwards i saw talked with gorky showing him a few pages my reminiscences he urged me go on writing suppressing nothing truth he even offered help me with my work but writing russia was at that time too dangerous a trade be followed with any degree confidence it was not until i was safely beyond frontiers that i dared begin writing freely at length i wish say however that it was principally due gorky s encouragement encouragement an american literary friend rheta childe dorr that i ventured attempt authorship rather that i undertook present world as they really were my sovereigns my best beloved friends my casual acquaintanceship with gorky was naturally seized upon by certain foreign journalists as evidence that i had gone over bolsheviki much abuse scorn were hurled against me how little those writers knew gorky his halfhearted support lenine policies he held an important office under communists it is true his wife a former actress was commissariat theatricals entertainments but no man bolshevist russia has ever been permitted more freedom thought speech than gorky he has done things which would have brought almost any other man torture death i know for example that he sheltered under his roof at least one romanoffs that man was finally assisted by him across finnish frontier gorky interested himself also fate several grand dukes nicholai michailovitch paul george who were arrested later shot death peter paul gorky did everything his power save these men whom personally he had no interest whatever he simply believed their murder be unjustified it is said that he actually induced lenine sign an order for their release deportation but order was signed too late men were brutally executed at christmas i had a great happiness nothing less than letters a parcel food from exiles tobolsk there were two parcels fact one containing flour sugar macaroni sausage wonderful luxuries other a pair stockings knit by empress s own hands a warm scarf some pretty christmas cards illuminated her wellremembered style i made myself a tiny christmas tree decorated with bits tinsel holly berries hung with these precious tokens affection remembrance nor was this only christmas joy vouchsafed me after a year sorrow suffering under escort my good old servant berchik i ventured attend mass big church near nicholai station a church built commemorate three hundredth anniversary romanoff succession after service an old monk approached me invited me accompany him into rfectoire his monastery i followed him a little unwillingly for one never knew what might happen entering i saw my astonishment about two hundred factory women who almost filled bare lofty room old monk introduced me women my bewilderment their leader came forward bowing holding her outstretched hands a clean white towel on which reposed a silver ikon it was an image our lady unexpected joy kind woman told me that she her fellow workers felt that after all that i had unjustly suffered fortress i ought have from those who sympathized with me an expression confidence goodwill she added that were i again trouble i might feel myself free take refuge lodgings any one them overcome with emotion i could utter only a few stammering words thanks i kissed good woman heartily all who could approached embraced me knowing that i longed for more tangible expressions gratitude good old monk pressed into my hands a number sacred pictures these i gave away as long as they lasted my new friends no words can tell how deeply i felt kindness these working women who out their scanty wages bought a silver ikon give a woman whom they knew nothing except that she had as they believed been persecuted for others sake i needed assurance that cruel world around me there were those who wished me well for first months new year came one bitterest sorrows my life death my deeply loved revered father he died very suddenly without any pain on january leaving world bereft one kindest most gifted sympathetic men his generation russia i have described my father as a musician a composer as well as a lifelong friend functionary imperial family his years service as keeper privy purse might have made him a rich man but so utterly honest was he that he accepted nothing except his moderate salary he died leaving almost nothing nothing but an unfading memory deep affection my friends including scores poor students whose musical education advancement he had furthered at his funeral his own compositions were sung by volunteer choirs his musician friends these followed his coffin long procession length nevski prospekt cemetery alexandra nevskaia lavra a monastic burial place where many our greatest lie everlasting repose my mother came live with me my obscure lodgings together we faced our desolate future one thing alone lightened darkness those days this was a correspondence daringly undertaken with my beloved friends siberia even now at this distance from russia i cannot divulge names those brave devoted ones who smuggled letters parcels from house tobolsk got them me small group faithful men women petrograd two chiefly concerned a man a woman course lived constant peril discovery death yet they gladly risked their lives that their sovereigns might have happiness private communication with their friends at this time their majesties were permitted write receive a few letters but every line was read by their jailers their list correspondents was rigidly censored even letters smuggled out from tobolsk utmost precautions had be observed reader can see with what veiled discreet phrases sentences are couched i give these letters exactly as they were written suppressing only certain messages affection too intimate make public most letters were written by empress but one at least came from emperor a number are from children me these letters are infinitely precious not only as personal messages but as proofs dauntless courage deep religious faith these martyrs russian revolution their patriotism their love country never faltered for a single moment nor did they ever utter a complaint a reproach against those who had so heartlessly betrayed them it seems me impossible that anyone reading these letters intended only for my own eyes can continue misjudge lives characters nicholas ii empress alexandra feodorovna what they reveal is their secret selves unknown except those who knew them best knowing them loved them as they deserved be loved first communication reach me was a brief message

story revolutionary russia it illustrates truth often demonstrated that tyranny oppression can never kill spirit freedom human beings there are always a minority people who hold their lives cheap by comparison with liberty such people lives deathlessly inspiration fidelity those they love no matter how relentlessly loved ones are persecuted poor as i was poor as was small group friends who worked with me communicate with imperial family we managed get them necessities they lacked dangerous difficult as travel was those days every traveler being almost certain be searched several times along way there were three two officers a young girl who at risk imprisonment death by most unspeakable tortures calmly fearlessly acted as emmissaries back forth between petrograd remote tobolsk they had

perhapsyet with a charming face a constantly sweet smile very thin long gray beard clever eyes his feeling for us is known all over country now by good ones therefore they took him away from us but

parents father have been utterly destroyed also my russian court dresses all others as well but destruction churches is worst all they say it was soldiers from hospital winter palace who did it we hear that soldiers smolny have seized all available food are quite indifferent prospect people starving why was money sent us rather than having been given poor true there were for us some very difficult times when we could not pay any bills when for four months servants had go without any wages soldiers here were not paid so they simply took our money keep them quiet all this is petty but it makes great trouble for commandant hofmarshall chancelerie is still existence but when they abolish it i really don t know what we shall do well god will help we still have what we need i think often livadia what may be happening there they say that many former political prisoners are stationed there where is our dear yacht standert i am afraid inquire about it my god how i suffered when i

little dear child do be careful people who come see way is so slippery it is so easy fall sometimes a road is cleared through snow on which one s true friends are walkand then road becomes still more slippery we are all right i am now a real mistress a household going over accounts with m gilliard new work very practical weather is sunnythey are even sunburned even when frost comes back it is warmer sun i have sat twice on balcony sometimes sit yard my heart has been much better but for a week i have had great pains it again i worry so much my god how russia suffers know that i love it even more than do miserable country demolished from within by germans from without since revolution they have conquered a great deal it without even a battle if they created order now russia how

whole we are better off than soon spring is coming rejoice our hearts way cross firstthen joy gladness it will soon be a year since we parted but what is time life here is nothingeternity is everything what we are doing is preparing our souls for kingdom heaven thus nothing after all is terrible if they do take everything from us they cannot take our souls have patience these days suffering will end we shall forget all anguish thank god god help those who see only bad don t try understand that all this will pass it cannot be otherwise i cannot write all that fills my soul but my little martyr understand it better than i are farther on than i we live here on earth but we are already half gone next world we see with different eyes that makes it often difficult associate with people who call themselves really are religious my greatest sin is my irritability endless stupidity my maid for instanceshe can t help being stupid she is so often untruthful else she begins sermonize like a preacher then i burstyou know how hottempered i am it is not difficult bear great trials but these little buzzing mosquitoes are so trying i want be a better woman i try for long periods i am really patient then breaks out again my bad temper we are have a new confessor second these seven months i beg your forgiveness too darling day after tomorrow is sunday before lent when one asks forgiveness for all one s faults forgive past pray for me yesterday we had prayers for dead we did not forget your father a few days ago was twentysixth anniversary my father s death i long warm comfort othersbut alas i do not feel drawn those around me here i am cold towards them this too is wrong me cowardly yielding bolshevist government triumphant germans was a source constant suffering empress subsequent letters written me that spring she speaks almost indifferently cold privations suffered house tobolsk but she becomes passionate when she writes german invasion what a nightmare it is that it is germans who are saving russia from communism are restoring order what could be more humiliating for us with one hand germans give with other they take away already they have seized an enormous territory god help save this unhappy country probably he wills us endure all these insults but that we must take them from germans almost kills me during a war one can understand these things happening but not during a revolution now batoum has been takenour country is disintegrating into bits i cannot think calmly about it such hideous pain heart soul yet i am sure god will not leave it like this he will send wisdom save russia i am sure it will always be me an immense gratification that midst her great pain sorrow for russia s piteous plight our small group friends petrograd those brave souls who dared risk their lives as message bearers were able get forlorn family desolate siberia at least necessities life which a cruel inefficient government deprived them empress who all her life had but command what she wanted for herself her children was grateful pathetically grateful for simple garments cheap little luxuries even materials for needlework we were able convey them she thanks me almost effusively for jackets sweaters we sent her girls their cold rooms wool was so soft nice but linen she feared was almost too fine this was early march but spring was already creeping across steppes weather is so fine that i have been sitting out on balcony writing music for lenten prayers as we have no printed notes we had sing this morning without any preparation but it wentwell not too badly god helped after service we tried sing some new prayers with new deacon i hope it will go better tonight on wednesday friday saturday mornings we were allowed go eight o clock morning service churchimagine joy comfort other days we five women will sing during home service it reminds me livadia oreanda this week we shall spend evenings alone with children as we want read together i know nothing new my heart is troubled but my soul remains tranquil as i feel god always near yet what are they deciding on moscow god help us peace yet germans continue advance farther farther wrote empress on march russian when will it all finish when god allows how i love my country with all its faults it grows dearer dearer me i thank god daily that he allowed us remain here did not send us farther away believe people darling nation is strong young as soft as wax just now it is bad hands darkness anarchy reigns but king glory will come will save strengthen give wisdom people who are now deceived for some reason empress seemed feel that lenten season was destined end an easter resurrection torn distracted country at least so her letters indicate a mood fitful kindness mercy bolshevist soldiers authority tobolsk allowed their captives go rather often church communion during this season empress was very happy consequence her letters were full prayers for country which whole family joined they appeared look forward easter as day when god would give some token that sins russian people for which they were suffering were forgiven yet never once did she speak regaining power throne all that was over forgotten neither emperor nor empress ever indicated any syllable that they expected be returned their former eminence fact they never spoke what might actually happen russian empire but they believed that god would hold it together restore its people wisdom strength for themselves they seemed look forward nothing better than an obscure existence with other russian people how uncomplainingly they accepted hard terms their lives how grateful they were for love distant friends whom they might never see again is shown all last letters i received from empress during march after receiving one our parcels clothing she wrote me we are endlessly touched by all your love thoughtfulness thank everybody for us please but really it is too bad spoil us so for are among so many difficulties we have not many privations i assure we have enough eat many respects are rich compared with children put on yesterday your lovely blouses hats also are very

written by her majesty s own hand a little later spring that year she emperor were hurriedly removed ekaterinaburgthe last place from which world has received tidings them children most suite were left behind tobolsk poor little alexei still ill suffering cruelly deprived solace his mother s love devotion may i received a brief letter from grand duchess olga who with difficulty managed get me news her parents family darling i take first opportunity write latest news we have had from ours ekaterinaburg they wrote on rd april that journey over rough roads was terrible but that spite great weariness they are well they live three rooms eat same food as soldiers little one is better but is still bed as soon as he is well enough be moved we shall join them we have had letters from zina but none from lili have alya your brother written weather has become milder ice is out river irtish but nothing is green yet darling must know how dreadful it all is we kiss embrace god bless olga illustration last photograph taken empress her daughters olga tatiana after this short letter from olga came a card from ekaterinaburg written by one empress s maids at her dictation it contained a few loving words news that they were recovering from fatigue their terrible journey they were living two roomsprobably although this is not stated under great privations she hoped but could not tell yet that our correspondence could be continued it never was i had a card a little later from mr gibbs saying that he m gilliard had brought children from tobolsk ekaterinaburg that family was again united card was written from train where he m gilliard were living not having been allowed join family their stockaded house mr gibbs had an intuition that both these devoted tutors were soon be sent out country such proved be case this was my last news my empress my sovereigns best all earthly friends july short paragraphs appeared bolshevist newspapers saying that by order soviet at ekaterinaburg emperor had been shot but that empress children had been removed a place safety announcement horrified me yet left me without any exact conviction its truth soviet newspapers published what they were ordered publish without any regard whatever facts thus when a little later it was announced that whole family had been murderedexecuted as they phrased itimagine executing five perfectly innocent childreni could not make myself believe it yet little by little public began believe it it is certain that nicholas ii his family have disappeared behind one world s greatest most tragic mysteries with them disappeared all suite servants who were permitted accompany them house ekaterinaburg my reason tells me that it is probable that they were all foully murdered that they are dead beyond sorrows this life forever but reason is not always amenable there are many us russia exile who knowing vastness enormous empire remoteness its communications with outside world know well possibilities imprisonment monasteries mines deep forests from which no news can penetrate we hope that is all i can say it is said although i have no firsthand information on subject that empress dowager has never believed that either her sons was killed soviet newspapers published accounts execution grand duke michail strong evidence has been presented that he was murdered siberia with others family including grand duchess serge these same newspapers however officially stated that grand duke michail had been assisted escape by english officers most fantastic contradictions concerning all these alleged murders have from time time cropped up when i was prison autumn a fellow prisoner chekha wife an aidedecamp grand duke michail told me positively that she had received a letter from emperor s brother safe well england perhaps strangest incident kind happened me when i was hiding from chekha after my last imprisonment my narrow escape from a kronstadt firing squad a woman unknown me approached me calling me by my name which course i did not acknowledge showed me a photograph a woman nun s robes standing between two men priests monks this she said mysteriously a whisper is one know well she sent it by my hands asks write her a message that are well also give your address that she may write a letter i looked long at photographa poor printand i could not deny myself that there was something a likeness face especially long delicate hands but empress had always been slender after her ill health became almost emaciated this woman was stout i might had i had slightest assurance safety have taken risk writing my name address for this stranger but no one russia takes such risks net chekha is too far flung i have one word more say about these letters empress alexandra feodorovna i have translated them as faithfully as literally as possible leaving out absolutely nothing except a few messages affection some religious expressions which seem me too intimate make public which might appear exaggerated western readers i have included letters which may be thought trivial subject but i have done it purposely because i yearned present empress as she was simple selfsacrificing a devoted wife mother friend an intense patriot deeply consistently religious she had her human faults failings as she freely admits some these traits can be described as french express it as faults her quality thus her great love for her husband which never ceased be romantic youthful caused her at times cruel heart pangs because this has nothing do with her life her story i should not allude one cloud that ever came between usjealousy i should leave that painful fleeting episode alone knowing that she would wish it forgotten except that certain letters which have been published she herself has spoken it so bitterly that were i omit mention it entirely i might be accused suppressing facts i have i think spoken frankly preference emperor for my society at times long walks tennis conversation early part empress was ill very lowspirited full morbid reflections she was much alone as emperor was occupied many hours every day children were busy with their lessons emperor s leisure moments he developed a more than ordinary desire for my companionship perhaps only because i was an entirely healthy normal woman heart soul devoted family one from whom it was never necessary keep anything secret we were much together those days before either us realized it empress became mortally jealous suspicious every movement her husband myself letters written during this period especially from crimea during spring empress said some very unkind cruel things me at least i should consider them cruel if they had not been rooted illness physical mental misery course court knew estrangement between us i regret say that there were many who delighted it did what they could make it permanent my only real friends were count fredericks minister court his two daughters who stood by me loyally kept me courage that this illusion jealousy was entirely dissipated that empress finally realized that my love devotion for her precluded any possibility things she feared her letters me from siberia amply demonstrate our friendship became more deeply cemented than before nothing but death can ever sever bond between us other letters written by empress her husband between have within this past year found publication by a russian firm berlin some them have been reproduced london times i have no doubt that they will also be published america these letters reveal character empress exactly as i knew her it is balm my bruised heart read london times that whatever has been said her betrayal attempted betrayal russia during war must be abandoned as a legend without least foundation so must also be discarded accusations against her any but spiritual relations with rasputine that she believed him as a man sent god is true but that his influence on her through her on emperor s policies had any political importance i must steadfastly deny both empress rasputine liked protopopoff trusted him but that had nothing do with his ministerial tenure empress i think also rasputine disliked distrusted grand duke nicholas but that had nothing do with his demission these affairs emperor made his own decisions as i have stated strongest proof what i have written will be found letters empress those she wrote emperor her relations germany england those included this volume nothing contradictory nothing inconsistent has ever been discovered despite efforts empress s bitter enemies provisional government bolshevists before all world before historians future alexandra feodorovna empress russia stands absolved chapter xxiii towards close summer life russia became almost indescribably chaotic miserable most shops were closed only few who could pay fantastic prices were able buy food there was a little bread a very little butter some meat a few farm products tea coffee had completely disappeared dried leaves taking their places but even these substitutes were frightfully dear very difficult find trouble was that bolshevist authorities forbade peasants bring any food into petrograd soldiers were kept on guard at railway stations confiscate any stocks that tried run blockade frequently market stalls were raided what food was there was seized merchants arrested food smuggling went on on a fairly large scale if one had money he could at least avoid starvation most people our class lived by selling one by one jewels furs pictures art objects an enterprising class jewish dealers having sprung up as by magic take advantage opportunity there was also a new kind merchant class people intelligentsia who knew value lace furs old china embroideries who dealt with us with more courtesy rather less avarice than jews my mother i fell into dire poverty a home we had even a few valuable jewels but we clung everything we had as shipwrecked sailors their life belts we could not look far ahead we viewed complete bankruptcy with fear dread i recall one bitter day that summer sitting down on a park bench weary desolate as any pauper for i had not my pocket money enough go home a tram i do not remember how i got home but i remember that that dark hour a former banker whom we had long known called at our lodgings told us that he had a little money which he was about smuggle imperial family siberia he wanted us accept twenty thousand rubles this for our immediate needs gladly we did accept it very soon afterwards banker suddenly mysteriously disappeared his fate remains this day a profound mystery i do not even know if he succeeded getting money siberia however with hope he inspired me i began think possible resources which i might turn account my hospital tsarskoe selo had been closed by bolsheviki but its expensive equipment furniture instruments horses carriages still remained i employed a lawyer go over books estimate what money i could realize from a sale whole property my dismay i learned that place with everything it had been seized by my director head nurse who under bolshevist policy confiscation claimed all ostensibly as state property but really as their own for they had become ardent bolshevists i made a personal appeal these old employees mine let me have at least one cow for my mother who being very frail needed milk they simply laughed at me my lawyer took steps protect my rights result this rash action was that former director denounced me chekha as a counterrevolutionist middle an october night our home was invaded by armed men who arrested me my nursing sister looted our rooms everything that caught their fancy among other things they took was a letter from emperor my father explaining conditions which led him assume supreme command army this letter treasured by me seemed them somehow very incriminating driven ahead soldiers i went downstairs climbed into a motor truck which conveyed us headquarters chekha gorohvaia street after my name had been taken by a slovenly official i followed guard one two large rooms which formed women s ward prison there must have been close two hundred women crowded these rooms they slept sometimes three a narrow bed they lay on tables even on bare floor air place was course utterly foul for many women were class that never washes some were gentle birth breeding accused no particular offense but held according bolshevist custom as hostages possible witnesses for others who were under examination who were wanted could not be found early morning all prisoners got up from their narrow beds hard floor made their way under soldier escort a toilet where they washed their faces hands as i sat miserably on edge my bed a woman came up me introducing herself as mlle shoulgine oldest inhabitant place therefore a kind a monitor it was her business she said see that each prisoner received food handle any letters petitions women might desire send out i told her that i desired send a petition head chekha whatever committee was charge prison asking nature charges against me begging for an early trial this petition was duly dispatched very soon after a very large man a jew came see me promised that my affair would be promptly investigated soldiers on guard spoke me kindly offered if i had money carry letters back forth from my home i gave them money was comforted hear from my mother that dr manouchine was once more working for my release although not a bolshevist doctor s skill was greatly respected by communists who had appointed him head physician old detention house there was a student doctor attached our prison merely because he was a friend dr manouchine knew that i was also he was courteous attentive me so potent is influence a truly great character five days i spent that filthy crowded cell will never leave my memory every moment was a nightmare twice a day they served us with bowls socalled soup hot water with a little grease a few wilted vegetables this with small pieces sour black bread was all food vouchsafed us some prisoners got additional food from outside usually these fortunate ones divided what they had with others there was one beautiful woman halfworld who daily received from some source ample food like most women her class she was generous i was told that she had been arrested because she had hidden helped her lover a white officer escape that she felt proud be suffering for his sake perhaps it was from friends his that she received food yet women her kind god knows very seldom meet with gratitude even from those who owe it most although i was accused no crime had no idea what accusations could be brought against me i lived as all others lived a state constant anxiety fear all day all night we heard sound motors motor horns we saw prisoners brought from our windows we could see great quantities loot which bolshevist soldiers had collected silver pictures rich wearing apparel everything that appealed them as valuable courtyard we could see men fighting like wolves over their spoils it was like living a pirates den rather than a prison yet we were often enough reminded that we were prisoners one day all women my room were roughly ordered into a larger room literally heaped with archives imperial government with soldiers standing over us we set work like charwomen sort papers tie them up neat bundles very often night when we were sleeping exhausted our cell rooms electric lights would suddenly be turned on guards would call out names half a dozen frightened women would get up gather their rags about them go out some returned some disappeared no one knew whose turn would come next what her fate would be name my nursing sister was called before mine within a short time she returned smiling say that she was be sent home at once that i should soon follow two hours later soldiers appeared at grating one called out my surname tanieva viborg prison i had spirit enough demand papers consigning me this dread women s prison but soldiers merely pushed me back with butts their guns bade me lose no time obeying orders i still had a little money with which i paid for a cab instead walking long distance prison i begged soldiers stop on way let me see my mother for this privilege i offered all money remaining my purse which soldiers took also bargaining for ring i wore on my hand this i declined give so they philosophically said oh well why not stopped cab at door my mother s lodgings course my poor mother was overjoyed see me even for a moment so was old berchik now almost at end his life both assured me that everything was being done my behalf that at viborg prison i would be less danger death than at chekha headquarters i might even hope be admitted prison hospital a little heartened spite myself i went on viborg which lies a far quarter town on what is known as viborg side neva a rather pretty bolshevist girl was charge receiving office when i pleaded ill health asked be sent hospital she promised see what could be done viborg prison was one many which during first frenzied days revolution were thrown open prisoners released wardresses murdered i do not know how other women were induced take their places but i do know that women whose charge i was placed were so kind considerate that had any attempt been made against them prisoners themselves would have fought their defense wardress who locked me my cell stopped say a comforting word because she saw that i was shivering with cold as well as nervousness she brought me bread a little hot soup after some hours i had another visitor princess kakouatoff accused being ringleader an antibolshevist plot who had been six months viborg was regarded as a trusty among other privileges she had right telephone friends new prisoners at my request she telephoned messages friends who could be use my mother if not me princess brought me a little portion fish which i ate hungrily i think she was also instrumental finally getting me into prison hospital this was after i had fainted on floor my cell everyone authority including prison doctor knew that i was no condition endure noisy confusion huge cell house hospital was a little cleaner than rest prison but it was a pretty dreadful place just same for nurses we had goodconduct prisoners women low type who stole food everything else they could lay hands on they stripped me my clothes substituting prison chemise blue dressing gown took away all my hairpins i was given a bed a room with six other women one them a particularly awful syphilis case two others very dirty who spent most their time going over each other s heads for vermin i stayed this ghastly place a very short time a woman doctor a prisoner my own class baroness rosen succeeding getting me transferred a better ward nevertheless whole prison hospital was horrible trusties charge wards were habit eating meat out prisoners bowls fighting for food among prisoners throughout institution was a daily occurrence i can describe viborg prison most its inmates one wordbeastly many women were syphilitic most were verminous some were half mad one who slept near me had murdered her husband burned his body nearly all sang most obscene songs held unrepeatable conversations mostly they were so depraved that doctor his rounds showed that he was afraid them yet there were among them a few women who like myself had led sheltered religious lives who were only now learning that such abandoned specimens womanhood existed on earth there was no attempt at reforming women once there had been a church attached prison but this bolsheviki had closed substituting a cinema which on special occasions some prisoners were admitted not many political prisoners had this privilege because they were treated much more rigorously than common criminals it was common criminals also thieves murderers prostitutes who were released advance counterrevolutionists those accused however vaguely political activities all prisons petrograd by this time were so crowded with socalled political prisoners that even women s prison was obliged receive an overflow sick men prisoners this wholesale imprisonment antibolshevists naturally led shooting thousands citizens shooting being simpler than feeding housing addition an economy effort on part those charged with mockery trials later chekha dispensed with this mockery but those days prisoners were given pretense a hearing i can testify their futility because i went through more than half a dozen trials no case was i accused any crime tried for any definite offense given anything like a fair hearing on september word was brought viborg prison that on next morning i was be taken away not return this seemed be a death sentence all that night i lay awake thinking my poor mother wondering what would become her alone midst bolshevist inferno silently long i prayed for her for peaceful release my own tried soul very early morning i was summoned my own clothes were given me i was led receiving office prison here two soldiers waited i was taken out between them marched headquarters chekha a small dirty room i underwent an examination by two jewish communists one whom vladimirovnearly all jewish communists assume russian namesbeing prominent councils communist central committee for fully an hour these men did everything they could terrorize me they accused me being a spy plotting against chekha being a dangerous counterrevolutionist they told me that i was be shot at once that they intended shoot all intellectuals bourju leaving proletariat full possession russia they continued this bluster until from sheer weariness they stopped then one men leaned his elbows on table with a smile that was meant be ingratiating said confidentially i tell what relate true story rasputine perhaps we won t have shot at least not today i assured man that i knew no more about rasputine than they did perhaps not as much since i had no access police records they had then they wanted know all about czar life court as well as i could i satisfied their curiosity which was that ignorant children at end an exhausting interrogation they actually sent me not a wall a firing squad but back filthy cell viborg prison i dropped on my dirty bed swallowed a little food brought me by a sympathetic fellow prisoner resigned myself for what next might happen me what happened was astonishing a soldier came door called out tanieva with your things go home within a short time i stood trembling weak on pavement front prison i could not have walked my lodgings fact i felt incapable walking at all but a strange woman observing me my piteous condition approached put her arm around me helped me into a drosky i had a little money perhaps fifty rubles i gave it all ischvostik drive me home here i found an amazing state affairs general immorality demoralization into which bolshevism was driving people having penetrated our own place everyone was turning thief my nursing sister who had been with me since whom my mother had treated like a daughter had become inoculated with virus evil woman had not only appropriated almost all clothes i possessed but had stolen all trinkets bits jewelry she could lay hands on she had even taken carpets from floors stored them her room not daring attempt regain any this property i asked nurse please take what she wanted leave apartment not at all she replied this place suits me very well as long as i choose i shall remain she had embraced bolshevism not i am sure from principle but as safest policy time she became rich jewels finery miscellaneous loot it was months before we finally induced her leave after her departure i have reason believe that she did everything she could keep me trouble with bolshevists by this time communist rgime was fully organized whole town was divided into districts each one under command a group soldiers who had full license searchand robhouses make arrests every night search went on at seven o clock all electric lights were turned off when two three hours later they suddenly flashed up again every soul district was seized with fear knowing that this was signal for invasion often women were included searching parties terrible women dressed silks strung with jewelry stolen course from hated bourju seven times our home was raided once on authority an anonymous letter charging that we were possession firearms once more i was dragged off an interminable examination this time before staff red army a house gogol street close connection between chekha red army was apparent because two hours during which i sat antechamber waiting examination a lettish official chekha passed freely out committee room occasionally throwing me a reassuring word my case would be settled favorably he said it was for committee after bullying me for a length time dropped subject concealed firearms assumed snobbish half cringing air with which i was becoming familiar point nausea began asking questions about imperial household they produced a large album photographs made me go through it identify each picture finally head inquisitor told me magnanimously that i could go home cleared by highest authority but that soldiers would go with me make sure that there were no revolvers pistols house search was made anew then men left obviously disappointed that practically nothing worth stealing had come light two things importance were happening those days white army was approaching petrograd all streets soldiers were drilling anticipation a battle airplanes whirred overhead once so often a shell screamed over housetops we prayed for coming white army at same time dreaded massacres we knew would precede its entry into town second thing that marked this date was communist system public feeding free food being furnished by cards distributed according status individual bolshevist authorities soldiers course had most food best next came proletariat socalled last all bourju was provided for these lowest strata society got hardly anything at all would have starved most them had it not been for food smuggling which constantly went on peasants from out town boldly bringing bulky parcels taking back return for their food not bolshevist money which they disdained but everything they could accumulate way furniture dress materials they even accepted window curtains table linen anything fact that could be fashioned into clothing these same peasants before revolution had been expert spinners weavers but now they scorned such plebeian occupations because it was easier barter grains milk vegetables other produce for last possessions townspeople we went on living somehow parting with clothing furniture burning boxes even chairs for fuel walking miles for stray bits wood praying for success white forces praying for protection against what must happen before that success could be achieved my mother all these days was very ill with dysentery which was rife petrograd i had that additional suffering for i knew that it would take little bring her frail life an end chapter xxiv on september october new style i went evening a lecture a church at that time every nonbolshevist spent as many hours every day as possible churches praying listening words hope comfort from priests church was fact only home peace rest whole distracted country that particular night church i met some old friends who invited me go home with them rather than walk long dreary even dangerous way back my lodgings i stayed with my friends that night next morning early i went mass little church where father john kronstadt lies buried i reached home about midday found place possession soldiers two whom had waited entire night arrest me this time as a hostage white army being reported within a few miles petrograd my sick mother prepared me a little food made a parcel my scanty linen once more we bade each other despairing farewell two who knew that they might never meet again on earth i was quickly conveyed headquarters chekha where i was greeted with exultant welcome aha here we have bird who has dared stay out a whole night thrust into old filthy illsmelling cell room i found a spot near a dirty window from which i could get a far glimpse golden dome st isaac s cathedral during my whole term this place i kept my eyes my whole mind on that golden dome trying forget hell that whirled around me woman charge room was a finnish girl who had committed crime trying run away finland she was a stenographer clerk chekha used her by night as an office assistant whether by nature by association she had become as hard as ruthless as her captors her imprisonment had many mitigations it was her pleasant duty make out lists those who twice a week were taken kronstadt be shot her reports on subject which she confided regularly her chosen comrade a georgian dancer named menabde were enough sicken even those us who had become accustomed wholesale slaughter unoffending human beings we heard little else except death threats death this place there was an official named boze prison often we heard him screeching through telephone his wife that he would be late dinner that night because he had a load game get off kronstadt under such conditions pity sympathy become strangely dulled on occasions when i was sent kitchens for hot water i used get glimpses game huddled wretchedly their seats restlessly pacing their cellswaiting often when i returned with water i found seats cells empty although my heart sank my senses swam i never felt screaming horror a normal person would have felt this dulling emotions i suppose is nature s way keeping mind from giving way entirely course nature took away all human dignity selfrespect this too mercy any prisoner who went kitchens was greeted with jeers foul abuse from cooks who threw us handfuls potato parings withered cabbage leaves quite as one would throw bones dogs like dogs we eagerly snatched at these leavings because prisoners regular rations were nothing half as palatable being mostly wormy dried fish a disgusting substitute for bread one day i was called up for examination this time a real surprise awaited me my judge was an esthonian named otto not altogether a brutal man as it turned out as i approached his desk he regarded me grimly without a word handed me a letter unsigned reading about as follows lady waiting anna viroubova are only one who can save us from this terrible bolshevik administration as are at head a great organization fully equipped with guns ammunition sternly esthonian judge commanded me tell him truth about organization which i was head course i told him that whole thing was an invention he astonished me by saying that although letter had been posted my address he had very much doubted its verity then he asked almost gently are very hungry taken off my guard as much by kindness as by prospect food i fell against desk murmuring only half aloud hungry yes oh yes whereupon he opened a drawer his desk handed me a large piece fresh sweet bread go now he said i will discuss your case with my colleague vikman evening we will see again at eleven that night i was again summoned this time before two men esthonian still kind courteous gave me a glass steaming tea which did much lend me courage both he vikman then put me through a searching examination especially about my relations real assumed with imperial family with persons court at three morning they released me more dead than alive with fatigue otto telling me heartily that he thought i would be set free within a few days vikman however declared that my case would have be referred moscow that i need not expect an early release i went back my evil cage expecting nothing i knew that threat white army advance filled with terror whole bolshevist population that case actual battle no life outside slim communist ranks would be worth smallest scrap their worthless paper money very shortly after my return cell room i began hear my name whispered from one wretched woman another i accepted this without much emotion as a prelude a boat journey kronstadt early on a certain morning a soldier approached door bawled out tanieva moscow i happened be exceedingly ill that day but mechanically i picked up my little handkerchief containing my few possessions including a bible followed escort two soldiers down steep steps as i believed my death perhaps they had orders take me kronstadt i cannot be sure that but i do know that route we followed did not lead moscow station we had walked but a short distance when one soldiers said other what s good two us bothering with one lame woman i ll take care her can go along it will soon be over anyway nothing loath other soldier glad get out anything resembling work took himself off while i charge one armed man mounted crowded tram rode on toward an unknown destination at a certain point we had change trams here occurred an incident so extraordinary that i almost hesitate strain credulity a nonrussian reader by relating it second tram had been delayed for some reason a considerable crowd passengers was waiting for it on street corner my soldier stood at my side waiting with rest but soon he became impatient ordering me not move an inch his absence he ran down street a short distance see if tram were sight as soon as he turned his back people crowd began speak me a girl whom i recognized a former acquaintance asked me where i was going when i told her she took a bracelet i gave her promised carry it with news my fate my poor mother an officer old army came up me saying are not anna alexandrovna when i said yes he too asked me where i was being taken kronstadt i think i answered but he said who knows pressed into my hands a roll bills saying that they might be use me other people surrounded me mostly strangers but two them women whom i had often seen at mass small church father john they said why should be shot soldier has not come back run while chance is yours father john will surely help encouraged by their sympathy yet hardly knowing what i was doing i limped off on my crutch much faster than i could have believed possible whole streetcorner crowd spreading out shield my flight i limped stumbled down michel street as far as nevski prospekt weeping praying all time god save me god save me until i reached old shopping arcade known as gostiny dvor here i caught sight my soldier running frantic pursuit his escaped prisoner it seemed all over with me then but i crouched a corner deserted building miraculously soldier ran on without seeing me as soon as i thought it at all safe i crept out old arcade turned into zagorodny prospekt where i found a solitary cab take me quickly i cried ischvostik my mother is dying man replied indifferently that he had a fare waiting but i thrust into his hands entire roll bills given me by friendly officer at same time climbing into drosky said ischvostik where shall i drive i gasped out address a friend suburbs city man lashed his halfstarved animal into a walk after what seemed me many hours we reached place i rang doorbell fell across threshold a dead faint my friend her husband courageously took me fed warmed me put me bed they even dared send word my mother that i was for moment safe from pursuit but they warned her not come near house as soldiers would certainly be watching her every movement as a matter fact my mother was visited by red soldiers arrested her bed closely guarded for three weeks our maid also was arrested as was everyone who came house old berchick who had spent almost his entire lifetime service our family was taken ill during this period died for five days his body lay uncoffined house bolshevist authorities refusing him a burial permit it was for my mother an interval utter despair since addition death berchick she lived constant fear my rearrest opinion bolshevist soldiers however i had escaped white army photographs me were posted conspicuously all railway stations kind friends who had taken me dared not for their lives keep me long wishing them nothing harm i set out on a dark night without a kopeck my pockets with no certain idea where i could find a bed i had mind a religious hostel a place where a few students men women lived under chaperonage an old nun there i went begging them for christ s sake take me there i was hidden for five perilous days a girl student volunteered go see my mother go she did but when hours passed a day passed she did not return a panic fear seized all us rather than expose these kind people risk imprisonment death i voluntarily left place what else could i do how shall i describe horrors next few months like a hunted animal i crept from one shelter another always leaving when it seemed at all possible that my protectors might be punished for their charity four nights i spent cell an old nun whom i knew but pitying her fears i put on black head kerchief a peasant woman started a cab on borrowed money for house a friend near alexandra lavra on outskirts town all unknown me a decree had that day been issued that no one could ride a cab without written permission from authorities consequently before we had traveled half journey cab was stopped by two women police fierce creatures armed with rifles who called out ischvostik halt we arrest your passenger hastily i crammed all money i had into ischvostik s hand begged women let me go as i had just been discharged from hospital knew nothing new rule oddly enough they let us drive on but very soon ischvostik sick with terror stopped his horse told me that he would take me no further i got out staggered on through muddy snow for it was now late autumn a former officer whom i had once known well met recognizing me asked if he might not accompany me my destination no no i cried it would be madness for be seen with me i cannot explain only go go as fast as can i staggered on dripping with rain until i reached my friend s

chekha inquisitor boze man who had several times been my brutal jailer grazhdanka citizeness he addressed me please tell me where find he named a street number whither he was bound doubtless on some errand terror giving him direction i moved on as fast as my crippled legs could carry me but i need not have been afraid for he did not know me at all so went year my mother i good priest s family often discussing possibilities escape from increasing starvation death terror which everywhere surrounded us people did escape we knew but how were we do ittwo women one old other lame it seemed altogether impossible besides we had almost nothing with which buy our way out country my only shoes were homemade affairs carpet i was so careful them that often when walking i took them off carried them my hands preserve them another thing beset with dangers as we were russia we were no longer hungry because i had an increasing number pupils each one meant a tiny portion food firewood for my mother my friends myself but here is a strange a universally human thing food warmth do not bring content prisoners they create courage when one day late october we received a letter from my sister safe a nearby country which i may not name flame adventure blazed up soul my brave little mother my own heart my sister suggested possibility our getting out by one ways that persist flourishing spite bolshevism chekha she offered us if we succeeded escaping shelter her own home i cannot reveal any detail those secret ways escape because they still exist must not any way be placed jeopardy enough it is say that petrograd is separated from finland by only a few versts land carefully guarded by a narrow arm baltic sea which cannot be quite as successfully guarded winter this water freezes not as unsalted water freezes smooth thick safe for passage but rough treacherous hummocks mixed ice snow with unexpected gaps halffrozen water opening here there between ice masses still icy baltic does at times admit sledge passage there are men who make a business taking overfor a price far beyond what most russians can affordrefugees who have friends waiting for them finland countries west south sometimes red soldiers have be bribed often they sell out people whose money they accept sometimes also men who contract take refugees over ice betray their passengers bolshevik guards any way look at it escape from bolshevik russia is about as perilous as going unarmed into a tiger s cage yet people dare it we did it was about first december our calendar year when we received a second smuggled letter from my sister be ready whenever we send for for that promised summons we waited desperate suspense until two days after christmas then my mother s lodging came a fisherman his little boy with whispered news that we were go with them on day following my mother found means sending news our friend priest he brought it me tomorrow at four o clock go abroad next day at appointed hour my mother i two shivering creatures facing death but ready met at a small railway station leading along baltic shores fisherman s son was also at station but obeying instructions we did not notice him but simply followed wherever he led our train journey was short at five o clock pitch dark russian winter we alighted at a poor village following boy who carried on his back a bag potatoes alas darkness confusion we lost him stood icy cold like lost souls not knowing where turn suddenly out shadows a peasant woman approached us are looking for a boy with a bag potatoes she said a low voice our frightened assent she murmured follow me we followed although for all we knew it was a chekha prison anybody russia may be chekha friend who invites dinner man who buys your last jewel woman who offers guide over an unknown road can trust no one consequently when must trust anyone we followed peasant woman into a dim hut there we found two fishermen who assured us that they were ready that night take us across frozen baltic a village on finnish side their horses sledges they told us were safely hidden but they would be ready take us three other fugitives a lady a child a maid as soon as we could safely venture leave village as luck would have it there was a festival a dance going on that night we had sit that stifling hut complete silence until two o clock also we had pay for our shelter escape one hundred thousand rubles which my mother had secured by selling her last treasure a pearl necklace when last peasant had gone bed silence wrapped village we stole out through mud snow got into rough sledge hardly had we struck rough ice baltic when sledge overturned waking child who silent before now began cry beg go home little thing spoke only french i can still hear him repeating over over again a high baby voice which he did not know imperiled lives all us maman maman  la maison  la maison for six hours we drove thus slowly cautiously over rotten ice one men driving other running ahead with a long pole testing ice for a safe pathway often we stopped listen for possible sentinels once neighborhood kronstadt we had such a fright that i wonder men dared go farther plainly our ears came grinding machinery we knew that where there was machinery there were men we stopped long listened until our driver suddenly remembered that noise was that an ice breaker several miles out our highway by this time i was so stiff drowsy with cold so nearly frozen fact that i hardly cared what happened us seeing my wretched state one men took off an extra pair woolen socks he wore slipped them on my feet unknown lady who accompanied us also spared me a warm wrap by rubbing holding me close their bodies they kept me alive at eight o clock a pale winter morning they lifted me out sledge with others i stood trembling on snowy shores finland now are out sovdepia soviet land said fishermen cheerfully but we are not safe yet for finnish police may catch us send us back hurriedly we climbed hill cottage one smugglers here we met his wife who gray with fear came out meet her husband after his night peril on ice woman gave us hot coffee bread cheese but she would not keep us long her house we knew that we must report as soon as possible at quarantine station we knew besides that sorely tried finnish authorities would not be any too glad see us coming do not blame finns for this every russian refugee is a burden on their slender resources too often a pretended refugee is merely a bolshevik agent sent stir up trouble among disaffected workmen however on this occasion finns received our wretched group with infinite kindness made us comfortable during required period we spent quarantine station then we went our separate destinations all us poverty obscurity homesickness that sunless clime which waits exile wherever he may go country where my mother i finally arrived we found my sister happier than ourselves because she left russia before great horror began thus saving part her fortune my sister gave us food clothing a lodging except for her bounty we had lost everything we ever owned home friends possessions country for russians now have no country no flag no place wide world best any us can hope for is an obscure corner some foreign land where we can earn enough buy our daily bread a quiet place which pray every day our lives god save russia i am told although i can hardly believe it that other lands even free america there are beings so deluded that they wish bring about revolution bolshevism i do not wish for any them long nightmare suffering that i one millions have suffered under revolution bolshevism i pray only that there may be revealed them fate betrayed who have died are dying under criminal administration

appendix a truth concerning russian imperial family statement vladimir michailovitch roudneff appointed by minister justice kerensky special high commissioner for revision investigation actions ministers other high personages imperial government i was acting as procureur court assizes ekaterinoslav when i received orders from minister justice kerensky become a member high commission inquiry charged with an examination acts abuses ministers other high personages former government while working with this commission petrograd i was especially assigned examination sources secret influences at court which were known as dark forces my work with commission lasted until august when i was forced leave because president mourvavieff insisted upon my making reports a plainly prejudicial character as an attorney general juge d instruction i had access all documents right be present at examination all witnesses with view establishing impartially part played by persons accused by society public press exerting influence on foreign domestic politics i was assigned read all papers letters found winter palace palace at tsarskoe selo at peterhof especially personal correspondence emperor empress certain grand dukes also correspondence seized course examination house archbishop varnava also countess s s ignatieff dr badmaeff voyeikoff anna viroubova also relations existing between imperial family german imperial family being aware importance my inquiry throwing light on historical events preceding following revolution i made copies all documents letters dossiers statements witnesses leaving petrograd i took with me all these copies concealing them my home ekaterinoslav but it is probable that these documents were destroyed when bolsheviki raided my house if by happy chance i find that they still exist i shall certainly publish them full without any comments my own meantime i consider it my duty write a short account principal persons who were accused being dark forces i must however warn reader that as i write from memory some details may escape my mind when i went petrograd begin my work with high commission i admit that i was influenced by all pamphlets newspaper articles on subject rasputine influence other rumors gossip i began my work under domination preconceived prejudices but careful impartial investigation soon forced me opinion that these rumors newspaper accounts were based on slender foundations most interesting person charged with exercising a malign influence on political affairs was gregory rasputine therefore this person was central figure my investigations account surveillance under which he lived up very day his death is great importance this surveillance was exercised by ordinary as well as secret police special agents noting all his goings comings some these agents being disguised as policemen as servants everything concerning movements rasputine was carefully recorded every day if he left his house even for an hour two moment his departure his return was noted also every person he met on road secret agents kept strict account all people he met all who visited him cases where names these persons were not known their full descriptions were taken after having read all papers examined many witnesses i reached conclusion that rasputine was a person more complex less comprehensible than had been previously represented studying his personality i naturally paid attention chronological order circumstances which finally opened man doors tsar s palace i discovered that first preliminary was his acquaintance with well known pious learned churchmen bishops theofan hermogen i noted also that it was afterwards due influence rasputine that these two great pillars orthodox church fell into disfavor he was cause relegation hermogen monastery saratoff disgrace demotion theofan after these two archbishops discovering rasputine s low instincts openly turned against him all evidence pointed conclusion that inner life rasputine a simple peasant government tobolsk there occurred suddenly a complete change transforming him turning him toward christ only this way can i explain myself his intimacy with these two remarkable bishops this hypothesis is moreover confirmed by rasputine s story his journey holy land this book is marked by extreme navet simplicity sincerity on recommendation exalted churchmen mentioned rasputine was received by grand duchesses anastasie nicholaevna melitza nicholaevna it was through them that he made acquaintance mme viroubova ne tanieff then maid honor he made a deep impression on this very religiously inclined woman gained at last an entry imperial palace it was then that awoke him his worst instincts hitherto repressed it was then that he began adroitly exploit religious fervor possessed by very high personages it must be admitted that he played his part with astonishing cleverness correspondence bearing on subject testimony various witnesses prove that rasputine refused all subsidies gratuities even honors which were freely offered him by their majesties indicating thus his integrity his disinterestedness his profound devotion throne insisting that he was an intercessor for imperial family before god s throne he alleged that everyone envied him his position that he was surrounded by intriguers slanderers that therefore evil reports concerning him were unworthy belief only favor he accepted was rental his lodgings paid by personal chancellor his majesty he also accepted presents made by hands imperial family such as shirts waistbands etc rasputine had free entry apartments emperor saying prayers addressing emperor empress with familiar thou greeting them siberian peasant manner with a kiss it is known that he warned emperor my death shall be thine also that at court he was regarded as a man gifted with power forecasting events his predictions were couched mysterious phrases like those pythons antiquity rasputine s income was derived from numerous persons who desired positions money used rasputine as their intermediary with emperor rasputine asked favors for his clients promising if these were granted all kinds blessings imperial family russia this must be added that rasputine possessed within himself a strange power by which he was able exercise hypnotic suggestion i have been able establish fact that he cured by hypnotism disease st vitus dance which afflicted son one his friends simanovitch young man was a student college commerce his malady completely disappeared after two sances which rasputine plunged patient into hypnotic slumbers another case establishing hypnotic power rasputine may be noted during winter he was called house superintendent railways tsarskoe selo where lay entirely unconscious anna alexandrovna viroubova who had been seriously injured a railroad accident she was suffering from broken legs a fracture skull their majesties were room when rasputine arrived he simply raising his arms said unconscious woman anushka open your eyes which she instantly did looking intelligently around her this naturally made a deep impression on everyone present including their majesties it served increase prestige rasputine although rasputine could barely read write he was far from being an inferior person he had a keen observant intellect a rare faculty reading character any person with whom he came contact rudeness exaggerated simplicity his bearing which lent him appearance a common peasant served remind observers his humble origin his lack culture as so much was bruited public press about immorality rasputine closest attention was given this phase his question from reports secret police it was proved that his love affairs consisted solely night orgies with musichall singers an occasional petitioner it is on record that when he was drunk he sometimes hinted intimacies higher circles especially those circles through which he had risen power but his relations with women high society nothing was established either by police records by information acquired by commission papers bishop varnava was found a telegram from rasputine as follows my dear i cannot come my silly women are shedding tears won t let me go as for accusation that siberia rasputine was accustomed bathe company with women that he was affiliated with khlysty sect extraordinary commission referred these charges gramoglassoff professor ecclesiastical academy moscow who after examination all evidence testified that among peasants many parts siberia common bath was a usual custom that he found no evidence writings preachings rasputine any affiliation with khlysty doctrines rasputine was a man large heart he kept open house his lodgings were always crowded with a curiously mixed company living at his expense acquire aureole a benefactor follow precepts gospels according which generous hand is always filled rasputine took money offered by his petitioners but he gave generously poor people lower classes who begged his assistance thus he built up a reputation being at once a generous a disinterested man besides these alms rasputine spent large sums restaurants cafs music halls streets so that when he died he left practically nothing investigation disclosed an immense amount evidence concerning petitions carried by rasputine court but all these as has been said referred merely applications for positions favors railway concessions like notwithstanding his great influence at court not a single indication rasputine s political activity was disclosed many proofs his influence were found papers general voyeikoff commandant palace as for example following my dear arrange this affair gregory these letters were annotated by voyeikoff with names addresses petitioners nature their demands results their applications date replies many letters same kind were found among papers president council ministers sturmer other high personages all letters concerned themselves exclusively with favors protection for people whom rasputine interested himself he had special names for various persons with whom he was frequent contact sturmer was called old man archbishop varnava butterfly emperor papa empress mama nickname varnava butterfly was found a letter mme viroubova inquiry into influence rasputine on imperial family was intensive but it was definitely established that that influence had its source profound religious sentiments their majesties joined their conviction that rasputine was a saint was sole intermediary between god emperor as well as all russia imperial family believed that they saw proofs his sanctity his psychic power over certain persons court such as bringing back life consciousness desperately injured mme viroubova whose case has been described also his undoubtedly benign influence on health heir on a whole series fulfilled forecasting events it is evident that sly unscrupulous people did everything their power profit by rasputine s influence on imperial family thus waking up man his worst instincts this is particularly true former minister interior a n khvostoff belezky director police department consolidate their position at court they came an understanding with rasputine whereby they agreed pay him out private funds police department sum three thousand rubles monthly besides other sums that he might require provided he helped them place candidates agreeable them rasputine accepted these conditions for three months filled his engagements but finding that arrangement was not advantageous himself returned his independent manner work khvostoff fearing that rasputine would betray him began openly oppose him he knew that he stood well with imperial family he counted also on coperation duma which he was a member which rasputine was cordially hated this put belezky a difficult position because he doubted khvostoff s power at court he had no doubt at all concerning rasputine s power belezky decided therefore betray his chief range himself on side rasputine his object was use words rasputine himself throw down khvostoff ministry struggle between these two officials culminated famous plot against life rasputine which created such a sensation press during year plot was laid by belezky following manner an engineer named heine owner several private gambling houses petrograd was hired go christiania meet unfrocked monk illiador troufanoff a former friend rasputine result this journey was a series telegrams addressed heine signed by illiador covertly alluding a conspiracy against life rasputine one these telegrams it was stated that forty men engaged conspiracy were dissatisfied wait longer it was necessary send them immediately thirty thousand rubles these telegrams coming war time from a neutral country were delivered police only after having been read being passed on person addressed finally after receiving all telegrams heine presented himself rasputine guise a repentant sinner giving him full details plot which he owned himself concerned but which he vowed khvostoff be leading spirit result was that rasputine took story imperial family dismissal khvostoff quickly followed it is an interesting fact that heine s telegrams from christiania mentioned a number names persons living tsaritzine former friends illiador who were supposed be christiania busy with details plot evidence given at inquiry proved beyond doubt that persons concerned had never left their homes personally official khvostoff was highly esteemed by both emperor empress they believing him be sincerely religious devoted interests imperial family russia but evidence shows that he was really devoted only his personal interests he once invited head gendarmerie general komissaroff go with him civilian dress introduce rasputine metropolitan pitirim they were received by a novice who went metropolitan s study announce them when metropolitan appeared rasputine introduced general komissaroff disagreeable as it was see a gendarme officer his house his eminence invited men follow him into his study there they discovered khvostoff sitting on a sofa seeing rasputine khvostoff laughed rather nervously but continued his conversation with metropolitan then rising take his departure asked general komissaroff drive home with him komissaroff found himself an awkward position when khvostoff suddenly asked him if he understood affair he answered negative well said khvostoff it is now clear what relation pitirim stands with rasputine when were announced he was just telling me that he had nothing common with rasputine that person who was waiting see him was an eminent georgian permit me he said leave for a few minutes now we see who eminent georgian really was this was testified by komissaroff himself all ministers khvostoff was closest rasputine rumors intimate relations between sturmer rasputine were found be without foundation there was between them it is true a friendship sturmer understood rasputine s great influence did what he could advance interests his clients he sent fruit wine delicacies rasputine but there is no evidence that he allowed him influence political affairs relations between rasputine protopopoff who for some reason rasputine called kalinine were no more intimate although protopopoff liked rasputine it is certain that rasputine defended protopopoff when position latter was menaced this was done usually absence sovereigns rasputine addressing himself empress at same time uttering predictions protopopoff distinguished himself by an extraordinary lack will power representing at different times quite opposing organizations he was even at one time elected vicepresident duma protopopoff has publicly been accused initiating carrying out an attempt put down popular uprising first days revolution he is accused having placed machine guns on roofs houses shoot down armed insurgents however juge d instruction jousvikkompaneitz after having interrogated many witnesses examining all machine guns found streets petrograd first days revolution has testified that all machine guns belonged different regiments none not even those found on roofs houses police generally speaking there were no machine guns on roofs except those placed there at beginning war as a defense against airplane attacks it must be said that during critical days february protopopoff showed a complete incapacity from legal point view his absolutely criminal weakness among his papers were found intimate even affectionate letters from rasputine but not one letter contained anything more than recommendations favor his protgs nor papers any other high personages were found letters different tenor signed by rasputine both press public seem have been persuaded that rasputine was very intimate with two political adventurers dr badmaeff prince andronnikoff that through him these men were able exercise wide political influence evidence has established however that these rumors were without any foundation two adventurers were fact nothing more than hangerson rasputine glad gather up crumbs from his table falsely representing their clients that they had influence over rasputine through him influence at court here follows at some length result high commission s inquiry into activities dr badmaeff prince andronnikoff but as they have nothing whatever do with this history they are omitted a v badmaeff was physician minister protopopoff but imperial family had no confidence his methodsany more than had rasputineand an examination servants imperial household it was demonstrated clearly that thibetan doctor had never been called his professional capacity apartments emperor s children general voyeikoff commandant palace i examined many times fortress petropavlosk where he was imprisoned he did not play a very powerful rle at court but according letters from his wife daughter court minister fredericks covering years found his house he was esteemed by imperial family as a man devoted throne an impression which i after several interviews with him did not share from letters voyeikoff his wife it is plain that he was hostile rasputine certain letters he calls rasputine evil genius imperial family russia he believed that his intimacy at court discredited throne gave strength humors opinions slanderous stories by which antigovernment party profited nevertheless he took full advantage influence rasputine he had not courage reject his petitions which is proved by annotations his handwriting on letters rasputine high commissioner roudneff adds that his opinion voyeikoff thought badly rasputine that his wife hated man but that neither them communicated their views imperial family a v having heard a great deal exceptional influence at court mme viroubova her relations with rasputine having read believed what was said about her society press i must admit that when i went examine her fortress petropavlosk i was frankly prejudiced against her this hostility remained with me up moment her entrance into office fortress under escort two soldiers as she entered room i was struck with expression her eyes an expression more than earthly gentleness meekness this first impression was confirmed all my subsequent interviews with her from first conversation which i had with her i became convinced that given her individuality her character she could never have had any influence on politics either foreign domestic i believe this first place because essentially feminine point view shown by her on all political matters which we talked second place because her loquacity her complete incapacity keep secret even facts which might reflect on herself i became convinced that ask mme viroubova keep anything a secret was equivalent proclaiming it from housetops because anything that she thought important she felt impelled communicate not only friends but possible foes noting these two characteristics mme viroubova i asked myself two questionswhy she stood close relations with rasputine what was secret her intimacy with imperial family i found answer first question conversations with parents mme viroubova m tanieff chief private chancellory his majesty his wife ne countess tolstoy from them i learned an episode life their daughter which my opinion explained why rasputine obtained later such an influence over will young woman at age thirteen mme viroubova fell gravely ill typhus illness being complicated with peritonitis her condition according physicians was desperate her parents called her bedside famous priest father john kronstadt following his prayers illness took a favorable turn young girl was soon pronounced out danger this made a deep impression on her mind thereafter strongly inclined her a religious life mme viroubova first met rasputine house grand duchess melitza nicholaevna wife grand duke peter that meeting was not a happy event grand duchess had prepared mme viroubova for meeting by conversations on subject religion had given her certain french books on occult subjects later grand duchess invited mme viroubova her house promising introduce her a great intercessor before god favor russia a man who possessed gifts prophecy faculty curing sick this interview by mme viroubova then mlle tanieff made a great impression on young woman who was then on eve marriage with lieutenant viroubova rasputine spoke only on religious subjects when young girl asked him if he approved her marriage he answered allegorically saying that pathway life was strewn not only with roses but with thorns that man progressed towards perfection only through sufferings trials marriage mme viroubova was from first unhappy according testimony mme tanieff man was completely impotent addicted perverted practices saddistic habits causing her daughter most frightful moral sufferings physical disgust nevertheless believing biblical injunction whom god hath joined let no man put asunder mme viroubova for a time kept her sufferings a secret even from her parents only after she had been nearly killed by her husband did she reveal them tragedy her marriage result was course a divorce testimony mme tanieff concerning moral character her soninlaw was confirmed by a medical examination mme viroubova ordered by commission inquiry by which was established virginity young woman this examination was held may consequence her shocking marital experience religious inclinations mme viroubova were increased were developed into something approaching religious mania she became purest most sincere admirer rasputine who up last day his life she considered a holy man one completely disinterested from every worldly point view regard question intimacy mme viroubova with imperial family i concluded that it had its roots wholly different mentalities empress mme viroubova that attraction opposites which so often seems necessary complete a balance two women were entirely different yet they had many things common both for example were devotedly fond music as empress possessed an agreeable contralto voice mme viroubova a good soprano they occupied many leisure hours singing duets such were conditions which produced minds persons ignorant nature intimacy between empress mme viroubova belief exceptional influence mme viroubova on court affairs as has been said mme viroubova possessed no such influence nor could she have possessed it empress dominated intelligence will mme viroubova but attachment between two women was very strong religious instincts deeply rooted their two natures explains tragedy their veneration rasputine relations between empress mme viroubova could be likened those a mother daughter nothing more my opinions regarding moral qualities mme viroubova resulting from interviews with her fortress petropavlosk winter palace were entirely confirmed by forgiving christian spirit displayed by her towards those who had caused her course her imprisonment most horrible suffering insults tortures which she was subjected fortress i did not learn first instance from mme viroubova herself but from her mother only on direct examination did mme viroubova confirm her mother s testimony even then she spoke calmly with astonishing meekness saying that her persecutors should not be blamed too severely because they did not realize what they were doing these tortures prison guards such as spitting her face dealing her blows on head body accusing her being mistress emperor rasputine tearing off her clothes threatening murder a sick woman who could walk only with aid crutches caused commission inquiry transfer prisoner a house formerly occupied by director gendarmerie house detention testimony mme viroubova presented a complete contrast that prince andronnikoff her statements were all candid sincere their truth was subsequently established beyond doubt by documentary evidence only fault i found with mme viroubova was her tendency wordiness her amazing habit skipping from one subject another without regard fact that she might be hurting her own cause mme viroubova appears have interceded at court for various persons but her petitions were received with a certain distrust because her known goodness her simplicity mind character empress alexandra was shown clearly her correspondence with emperor with mme viroubova this correspondence french english is filled with sentiments affection for her husband children empress occupied herself personally with education her children she often indicates her letters that it is desirable not spoil them give them habits luxury correspondence reveals also deep piety empress her letters her husband she often describes her emotions during religious services speaks peace tranquillity her soul after prayer hardly ever course this long correspondence are any allusions made politics letters concern intimate family affairs only passages which rasputine is mentioned she speaks him as that holy man shows that she considers him one sent god a prophet a man who prays sincerely for imperial family through whole correspondence which covers a period ten years i found not one single letter written german according testimony court adherents i have proof that before war german was never spoken at court because public rumors sympathy empress for germany existence palace at tsarskoe selo private wires berlin i made a careful examination apartments imperial family i found no indications at all communications between imperial household russia imperial household germany i also examined rumors concerning beneficence empress towards german wounded prisoners war i found that empress showed compassion for sufferings germans russians alike without distinction desiring fulfill injunction christ who said that whoever visited sick suffering also visited himself for these reasons above all on account frail health empress who suffered from a disease heart imperial family led a very retired life which favored development especially empress extreme piety inspired by her devotion empress introduced into certain churches attached court a rgime monastic services followed with delight spite her ill health up very end masses which lasted for hours on end this same excessive religious zeal was foundation for her admiration for gregory rasputine who possessing an extraordinary power suggestion exercised an undeniably salutary effect on invalid tsarevitch because her extreme piety empress was no proper state mind understand real source amazing influence rasputine on health heir she believed explanation be due not at all hypnotism but celestial gifts which rasputine owed sanctity his life a year a half before revolution former monk illiador troufanoff sent his wife from christiania petrograd with proposal that imperial family purchase manuscript his book which later appeared under title holy devil which relations imperial family with rasputine were scandalously represented police department interested itself matter at its own imminent risk entered into negotiations with wife illiador concerning purchase manuscript for which illiador demanded i am assured sixty thousand rubles affair was finally submitted empress alexandra who repudiated with indignation vile proposition illiador saying that white could never be made black that an innocent person could never be assoiled terminating this inquiry i believe it necessary repeat that bishops theofan hermogen contributed importantly introduction rasputine at court it was because their recommendations that empress beginning received rasputine cordially confidently her sentiments towards him were fortified only by reasons indicated course this document appendix b copy certificate
